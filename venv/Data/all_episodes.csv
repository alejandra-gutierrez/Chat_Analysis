0,viserys, m,viserys, You dare! You give commands to me? To me? You do not command the dragon. I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. I don't take orders from savages or their sluts. Do you hear me?,3,1,35
1,viserys, m,viserys, Kill these Dothraki dogs! I am your King!,3,1,8
2,viserys, m,viserys, I have no interest in hospitality or comfort. I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfils his end of the bargain and I have my crown.,2,1,25
3,viserys, m,viserys," Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, I suppose it is preferable to beheading. What did Ned Stark want you for? Buying from a slaver?",2,1,26
4,viserys, m,viserys," Under my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense. You can rest assured of that.",2,1,16
5,viserys, m,viserys, Daenerys!,1,1,1
6,viserys, m,viserys, Daenerys! There’s our bride to be! Look – a gift from Illyrio. Touch it. Come on. Feel the fabric. Mmmm. Isn’t he a gracious host?,1,1,25
7,viserys, m,viserys," Illyrio is no fool. He knows I won’t forget my friends when I come into my throne. You still slouch. Let me see. (He pulls off her gown.) You have a woman’s body now. (She endures it as he strokes her breast.) I need you to be perfect today. Can you do that for me? You don’t want to wake the dragon, do you?",1,1,64
8,viserys, m,viserys," When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today.",1,1,16
9,viserys, m,viserys, Where is he?,1,1,3
10,viserys, m,viserys, Where’s he going?,1,1,3
11,viserys, m,viserys, But he didn’t say anything. Did he like her?,1,1,9
12,viserys, m,viserys, When will they be married?,1,1,5
13,viserys, m,viserys, Is it true they lie with their horses?,1,1,8
14,viserys, m,viserys, Do you take me for a fool?,1,1,7
15,viserys, m,viserys, I know how to play a man like Drogo. I give him a queen and he gives me an army.,1,1,20
16,viserys, m,viserys," So do I. I want us both to go home. But they took it from us. So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?",1,1,26
17,viserys, m,viserys," We go home with an army. With Khal Drogo’s army. I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if that’s what it took.",1,1,30
18,viserys, m,viserys, When do I meet with the Khal? We need to begin planning the invasion.,1,1,14
19,viserys, m,viserys, When?,1,1,1
20,viserys, m,viserys, I piss on Dothraki omens. I waited 17 years to get my throne back.,1,1,14
21,viserys, m,viserys, Make him happy.,1,1,3
22,viserys, m,viserys," I'll call them what I like, because they're my people. This is my army. Khal Drogo is marching the wrong way with my army.",4,1,24
23,viserys, m,viserys," Yes, my dear?",4,1,3
24,viserys, m,viserys, They do.,4,1,2
25,viserys, m,viserys, It's entirely possible.,4,1,3
26,viserys, m,viserys," The brave men didn't kill dragons. The brave men rode them. Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen. The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne, which the Usurper is keeping warm for me. The swords of the vanquished, a thousand of them... melted together like so many candles.",4,1,58
27,viserys, m,viserys,Really? Why dragons?,4,1,3
28,viserys, m,viserys," Well, after 15 years in a pleasure house, I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy.",4,1,17
29,viserys, m,viserys, What have you seen?,4,1,4
30,viserys, m,viserys, A pirate ship?,4,1,3
31,viserys, m,viserys," I don't know. The Usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect. Scattered to the wind.",4,1,16
32,viserys, m,viserys," Yes, it is. What did I buy you for? To make me sad?",4,1,13
33,viserys, m,viserys, To teach my sister how to be a better lover? You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy? You pretty little idiot. Go on then. Get on with it.,4,1,31
34,viserys, m,viserys, You send this whore to give me commands? I should have sent you back her head!,4,1,16
35,viserys, m,viserys, How many times do I have to tell you? You do not command me.,4,1,14
36,viserys, m,viserys, What's this?,4,1,2
37,viserys, m,viserys, Dothraki rags? Are you going to dress me now?,4,1,9
38,viserys, m,viserys, This stinks of manure. All of it.,4,1,7
39,viserys, m,viserys," You would turn me into one of them, wouldn't you? Next you'll want to braid my hair.",4,1,17
40,viserys, m,viserys, You do not talk back to me!,4,1,7
41,viserys, m,viserys, You are a horselord's slut. And now you've woken the dragon...,4,1,11
42,viserys, m,viserys, She has to eat a whole heart? I hope that wasn’t my horse.,6,1,13
43,viserys, m,viserys, She’ll never keep it down.,6,1,5
44,viserys, m,viserys, Tell me what she is saying.,6,1,6
45,viserys, m,viserys, He won’t be a real Targaryen. He won’t be a true dragon.,6,1,12
46,viserys, m,viserys, They love her.,6,1,3
47,viserys, m,viserys, It’s not my law.,6,1,4
48,viserys, m,viserys, Whatever is hers is also mine.,6,1,6
49,viserys, m,viserys," I need a large army… I’m the last hope of a dynasty, Mormont. The greatest dynasty this world has ever seen, on my shoulders since I was five years old and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent. Never. Not a piece of it… How can I carry what I need to carry without it? Hmm? Who can rule without wealth, or fear, or love? Oh, you stand there, all nobility and honor. You don’t think I see you looking at my little sister, hmm? Don’t think I know what you want? I don’t care. You can have her. She can be queen of the savages and dine on the finest bloody horseparts, and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like. But let me go.",6,1,135
50,viserys, m,viserys, You swore an oath to me. Does loyalty mean nothing to you?,6,1,12
51,viserys, m,viserys, And yet here you stand?,6,1,5
52,viserys, m,viserys, Daenerys! Where’s my sister?,6,1,4
53,viserys, m,viserys, Where is she? I’m here for the feast. The whore’s feast.,6,1,11
54,viserys, m,viserys, Get your hands off me! No one touches the dragon!,6,1,10
55,viserys, m,viserys, Khal Drogo! I’m here for the feast.,6,1,7
56,viserys, m,viserys, That is no place for a king.,6,1,7
57,viserys, m,viserys, Keep away from me!,6,1,4
58,viserys, m,viserys, There she is.,6,1,3
59,viserys, m,viserys," They can’t kill us. They can’t shed blood in their sacred city. (moving his sword over everyone in the room, stopping on Daenerys’ stomach) But I can. I want what I came for. I want the crown he promised me. He bought you. But he never paid for you.",6,1,49
60,viserys, m,viserys, Tell him I want what was bargained for or I’m taking you back. He can keep the baby. I’ll cut it out and leave it for him.,6,1,27
61,viserys, m,viserys, What’s he saying?,6,1,3
62,viserys, m,viserys, That was all I wanted. W-what was promised.,6,1,8
63,viserys, m,viserys, No! You cannot touch me! I am the dragon! I am the dragon! I want my crown! Ahh!,6,1,18
64,viserys, m,viserys," No. Dany! Dany, tell them, make them! You can’t!",6,1,9
65,viserys, m,viserys, Dany please!,6,1,2
66,rickon, m,rickon, Old Nan said they turn your skull into a cup and make you drink your own blood from it.,9,3,19
67,rickon, m,rickon, That’s what Old Nan said.,9,3,5
68,rickon, m,rickon, What’s That?,9,3,2
69,rickon, m,rickon, Where?,9,3,1
70,rickon, m,rickon, [Surprised] Me? I’m coming with you.,9,3,6
71,rickon, m,rickon, I’m coming with you.  I’m your brother.  I have to protect you.,9,3,12
72,rickon, m,rickon, We’re not Southerners.,9,3,3
73,rickon, m,rickon, And I don’t want to leave you.,9,3,7
74,rickon, m,rickon," [Crying, looks at OSHA]  I know how to swing a sword.",9,3,11
75,rickon, m,rickon, What's happening?,6,3,2
76,rickon, m,rickon, What's wrong with him?,6,3,4
77,rickon, m,rickon, We'll make you better. LUWIN I feel just fine.,10,2,9
78,rickon, m,rickon, (cries),10,2,1
79,rickon, m,rickon, Do something!,6,2,2
80,rickon, m,rickon,  I'm fine.,7,2,2
81,rickon, m,rickon, Jack and Billy. They'll give us some food.,7,2,8
82,rickon, m,rickon,  They've all gone away.,8,1,4
83,rickon, m,rickon,"  No, they won't.",8,1,3
84,rickon, m,rickon,"  Here, Shaggydog.",10,1,2
85,rickon, m,rickon,  He doesn't like chains.,10,1,4
86,rickon, m,rickon,"  No, l came to see Father.",10,1,6
87,rickon, m,rickon,  He was down here. l saw him.,10,1,7
88,rickon, m,rickon,"  Last night, when l was sleeping. Here, Shaggydog.",10,1,8
89,robb, m,robb, No.,9,3,1
90,robb, m,robb," If we take Tywin's castle from him, the lords of Westeros will realize he's not invincible.  Take his home, take his gold, take his power.",9,3,25
91,robb, m,robb, You begged me not to send Theon to negotiate with his father and I ignored your advice.,9,3,17
92,robb, m,robb, Now Winterfell is burned to the ground.  The North is overrun with Ironborn and Bran and Rickon are gone.,9,3,19
93,robb, m,robb," So, Casterly Rock?  I'm asking your advice.",9,3,7
94,robb, m,robb, If Walder Frey cooperates.,9,3,4
95,robb, m,robb, We'll lose the war and die the way father died. Or worse.,9,3,12
96,robb, m,robb," We thank you for your hospitality, my lord.",9,3,8
97,robb, m,robb," I have come to make my apologies, my lord, and to beg your forgiveness.",9,3,14
98,robb, m,robb," My ladies.  All men should keep their word, kings most of all.  I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow.  The fault is not with you.  Any man would be lucky to have any one of you.  I did what I did not to slight you, but because I loved another.  I know these words cannot set right the wrong I have done to you and your house.  I beg your forgiveness and pledge to do all I can to make amends so the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell may once again be friends.",9,3,103
99,robb, m,robb," Thank you, my lord.",9,3,4
100,robb, m,robb, My mother’s alone with Roose Bolton.  I should rescue her.,9,3,10
101,robb, m,robb, Be kind.  She’s finally starting to like you.,9,3,8
102,robb, m,robb, Perhaps I’ve made a terrible mistake.,9,3,6
103,robb, m,robb, Striking your king is an act of treason.,9,3,8
104,robb, m,robb," [Gets up from his seat and addresses WALDER] If you think the time is right, Lord Walder, by all means, let us bed them.",9,3,24
105,robb, m,robb, I suppose it does seem strange from a foreigner’s perspective.,9,3,10
106,robb, m,robb," It’s tradition. [TALISA stares at ROBB]  Without the bedding ceremony, there’s no real proof the lord and lady consummated their marriage.",9,3,21
107,robb, m,robb, Boy or girl?,9,3,3
108,robb, m,robb," Oh, do you?   It seems to me the father should have some say in his son’s naming.",9,3,17
109,robb, m,robb, I do.,9,3,2
110,robb, m,robb, Mother.,9,3,1
111,robb, m,robb, It's not about glory. Your instructions were to wait for him to come to you.,3,3,15
112,robb, m,robb, What value was the mill?,3,3,5
113,robb, m,robb, Is he there now? Of course not.,3,3,7
114,robb, m,robb," I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west, into our country where we could surround him and kill him. I wanted him to chase us, which he would have done because he is a mad without a strategic thought in his head. I could have that head on a spike by now. Instead, I have a mill.",3,3,58
115,robb, m,robb, Willem and Martyn Lannister are 14 years old.,3,3,8
116,robb, m,robb, Tywin Lannister has my sisters. Have I sued for peace?,3,3,10
117,robb, m,robb, Do you think he'll sue for peace because we have his father's brother's great-grandsons?,3,3,14
118,robb, m,robb, How many men did you lose?,3,3,6
119,robb, m,robb, We need our men more than Tywin needs his!,3,3,9
120,robb, m,robb,  You would have. Right here today at this gathering if you had been patient.,3,3,14
121,robb, m,robb, You know who isn't? Tywin Lannister.,3,3,6
122,robb, m,robb, Did you ever think you'd marry one?,2,3,7
123,robb, m,robb, Never?,2,3,1
124,robb, m,robb, We'll travel to the funeral together. Lord Bolton will garrison here until we return.,2,3,14
125,robb, m,robb," By the time Bolton's bastard-RAMSAY got to Winterfell, the ironborn were gone. They massacred everyone and put the castle to the torch. And BRAN and RICKON have not been found. They may have escaped. Or Theon may have taken them back to the Iron Islands as hostages.",2,3,47
126,robb, m,robb, No.,2,3,1
127,robb, m,robb, There won't be a siege. The Mountain can't defend a ruin.,1,3,11
128,robb, m,robb, The Lannisters have been running from us since Oxcross. I'd love a fight. The men would love a fight. I don't think we're going to get one.,1,3,27
129,robb, m,robb, Find her a chamber that will serve as a cell.,1,3,10
130,robb, m,robb, She freed Jaime Lannister. The Lannisters robbed them of their sons and she robbed them of their justice.,1,3,18
131,robb, m,robb," What's your name, friend?",1,3,4
132,robb, m,robb, Bring them in.,5,3,3
133,robb, m,robb, Is that all of them? It took five of you to murder two unarmed squires?,5,3,15
134,robb, m,robb, Vengeance? Those boys didn't kill your sons. I saw Harrion die on the battlefield and Torrhen--,5,3,16
135,robb, m,robb, They were boys! Look at them.,5,3,6
136,robb, m,robb, My mother had nothing to do with this. This was your treason.,5,3,12
137,robb, m,robb, Leave him.,5,3,2
138,robb, m,robb, Escort Lord Karstark to the dungeon. Hang the rest.,5,3,9
139,robb, m,robb, This one was only the watcher. Hang him last so he can watch the others die.,5,3,16
140,robb, m,robb, Would you make me a liar as well as a murderer?,5,3,11
141,robb, m,robb," I'm not fighting for justice if I don't serve justice to murderers in my ranks, no matter how highborn. He has to die.",5,3,23
142,robb, m,robb, You tended to their wounds. You brought them supper. Now they're dead.,5,3,12
143,robb, m,robb, That didn't stop you from betraying me. And it won't save you now.,5,3,13
144,robb, m,robb," Kneel, my lord.",5,3,3
145,robb, m,robb," Rickard Karstark, Lord of Karhold, here in sight of gods and men, I sentence you to die. Would you speak a final word?",5,3,23
146,robb, m,robb, You were right.,5,3,3
147,robb, m,robb, The Karstarks are gone. Almost half our forces. Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel. Nothing. Only wait.,5,3,23
148,robb, m,robb, What can I do? Attack King's Landing? There's nothing he'd like better. He'd crush us in a day.,5,3,18
149,robb, m,robb," Winter could last five years. Once my bannermen are home again, sitting by the fire, surrounded by their families, warm and safe, they'll never ride south again. When I gathered my lords together, we had a purpose, a mission. Now we're like a band of bickering children.",5,3,47
150,robb, m,robb, What?,5,3,1
151,robb, m,robb, Here. And we're here. King's Landing--,5,3,6
152,robb, m,robb," I can't force them to meet us in the field and I can't attack them where they're strongest, but I can attack them where they're not.",5,3,26
153,robb, m,robb, And Casterly Rock can't run away. I'm going to take their home away from them.,5,3,15
154,robb, m,robb, Thank you for riding here so quickly. I know travel isn't easy in these times.,6,3,15
155,robb, m,robb, We are fighting for the North. Harrenhal is not in the North. It is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it.,6,3,29
156,robb, m,robb, We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs.,6,3,13
157,robb, m,robb, He has every right to be. Please excuse us while we discuss it.,6,3,13
158,robb, m,robb, He's a proud man and we've wounded him.,6,3,8
159,robb, m,robb," It's all right. You heard him. If you refuse, our alliance with the Freys is dead.",6,3,16
160,robb, m,robb, I have a war to fight. We can't win it without them. I have no time to haggle. You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill.,6,3,29
161,robb, m,robb," I've won every battle, but I'm losing this war. If we don't do this and do it now, we're lost.",6,3,20
162,robb, m,robb," You're paying for my sins, Uncle. It's not fair or right. I'll remember it.",6,3,14
163,robb, m,robb, Frey will wait. He knows we're coming.,7,3,7
164,robb, m,robb, Edmure is the best match a Frey has had in the history of their house. We should all get some sleep.,7,3,21
165,robb, m,robb," If you don't put some clothes on, I can't promise I won't attack you again.",7,3,15
166,robb, m,robb, Who are you writing?,7,3,4
167,robb, m,robb, Is that Valyrian?,7,3,3
168,robb, m,robb, Gaaa? (sighs) Say hello for me.,7,3,6
169,robb, m,robb, 'Ritsas.',7,3,1
170,robb, m,robb, Does she know her daughter's a queen?,7,3,7
171,robb, m,robb," That will be a surprise, I expect.",7,3,7
172,robb, m,robb, How am I supposed to sit here planning a war when you're over there looking like that?,7,3,17
173,robb, m,robb,  I will.,7,3,2
174,robb, m,robb," What, now?  Are you certain?",7,3,5
175,robb, m,robb,  Angry? You're my queen.,7,3,4
176,robb, m,robb, Maybe one of each.,7,3,4
177,robb, m,robb,  I love you. Do you hear me?  I love you.,7,3,10
178,robb, m,robb, King in the North!,2,4,4
179,robb, m,robb, I am the rightful king.,2,4,5
180,robb, m,robb, Take that. -,2,4,3
181,robb, m,robb, I am the King in the North!,2,4,7
182,robb, m,robb,  I've never met her.,8,2,4
183,robb, m,robb," Frey, I suppose. I don't know her first name.",8,2,9
184,robb, m,robb, An important bridge.,8,2,3
185,robb, m,robb," It was before they killed my father. I still thought I could march south and rescue him in time, but only if I crossed that bridge.",8,2,26
186,robb, m,robb," He was the best man I ever met. I know children always think that about their fathers, but",8,2,18
187,robb, m,robb," He once told me that being a lord is like being a father, except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them. The farmers plowing the fields are yours to protect. The charwomen scrubbing the floors, yours to protect. The soldiers you order into battle. He told me he woke with fear in the morning and went to bed with fear in the night. I didn't believe him. I asked him, ""How can a man be brave if he's afraid?"" ""That is the only time a man can be brave,"" he told me.",8,2,97
188,robb, m,robb, He would have liked you.,8,2,5
189,robb, m,robb, He didn't care much about gold or glory.,8,2,8
190,robb, m,robb, Because we'll never be safe until the Lannisters are defeated. And because I believe in justice.,8,2,16
191,robb, m,robb, That would be a start.,8,2,5
192,robb, m,robb, How? How?,8,2,2
193,robb, m,robb, Tell me this isn't true.,8,2,5
194,robb, m,robb, Why?,8,2,1
195,robb, m,robb, No! You knew I would not allow it and you did it anyway.,8,2,13
196,robb, m,robb, Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool. You've weakened our position. You've brought discord into our camp. And you did it all behind my back. Make sure she's guarded day and night.,8,2,33
197,robb, m,robb, Send another 40 with our fastest horses.,8,2,7
198,robb, m,robb, Still no word?,8,2,3
199,robb, m,robb, Theon has my brothers. If we storm the castle,8,2,9
200,robb, m,robb, Send word to your son. Any ironborn who surrender will be allowed to return safely to their homes.,8,2,18
201,robb, m,robb, Any ironborn with the exception of Theon Greyjoy. He betrayed our cause. He betrayed me. And we will hunt him down no matter where he runs.,8,2,26
202,robb, m,robb, How am I? I've had to arrest my mother. The Lannisters have my sisters. The man I considered my closest friend has seized my home and my brothers. I'm fighting a war and I don't know if I should march south or north.,8,2,43
203,robb, m,robb, No. Forgive me. You're being kind. I have no right.,8,2,10
204,robb, m,robb, That's not the kind of king I want to be.,8,2,10
205,robb, m,robb, I don't know. The good kind. Most kings grew up as princes. They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown. I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.,8,2,29
206,robb, m,robb, I'd like to hear you play the harp.,8,2,8
207,robb, m,robb, How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry to sawing off men's feet?,8,2,13
208,robb, m,robb, I don't want to marry the Frey girl.,8,2,8
209,robb, m,robb, But you needed that bridge. I hope it's a very beautiful bridge.,8,2,12
210,robb, m,robb, I know that.,10,2,3
211,robb, m,robb, I love her.,10,2,3
212,robb, m,robb, It is important to me.,10,2,5
213,robb, m,robb," And that is what would be in store for me with one of Walder Frey's daughters,  what you and father had?",10,2,21
214,robb, m,robb, Now you're arguing just to argue because you arranged it.,10,2,10
215,robb, m,robb, My father is dead. And the only parent I have left has no right to call anyone reckless.,10,2,18
216,robb, m,robb," Father, smith, warrior, mother ,maiden, crone, stranger.",10,2,7
217,robb, m,robb, I am hers and she is mine from this day until the end of my days.,10,2,16
218,robb, m,robb, I’m sending one of your cousins down to King’s Landing with my peace terms.,2,2,14
219,robb, m,robb, Men who fought my father.,2,2,5
220,robb, m,robb, I need his ships.,2,2,4
221,robb, m,robb," If I left you with one of my bannermen, your father would know within a fortnight, and my bannerman would receive a raven with a message, ""Release my son and you'll be rich beyond your dreams. Refuse and your house will be destroyed, root and stem.”",1,2,46
222,robb, m,robb," Oh, I trust them with my life. Just not with yours.",1,2,11
223,robb, m,robb," You insult yourself, Kingslayer. You've been defeated by a boy.",1,2,10
224,robb, m,robb, You're held captive by a boy. Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy. (Grey Wind enters the cage. Jaime looks very nervous). Stannis Baratheon sent ravens to all the high lords of Westeros. King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king nor a true Baratheon. (Jaime focuses back on Robb). He's your bastard son.,1,2,54
225,robb, m,robb, My father learned the truth. That's why you had him executed.,1,2,11
226,robb, m,robb, Your son killed him so the world wouldn't learn who fathered him. And you... you pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the queen.,1,2,28
227,robb, m,robb, I'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing with my peace terms.,1,2,14
228,robb, m,robb," No, but he's starting to know me.",1,2,7
229,robb, m,robb, It's better than three defeats.,1,2,5
230,robb, m,robb, You're Ser Alton Lannister?,1,2,4
231,robb, m,robb," I offer your cousins peace if they meet my terms. First, your family must release my sisters. Second, my father's bones must be returned to us so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell. And the remains of all those who died in his service must also be returned. Their families can honor them with proper funerals.",1,2,63
232,robb, m,robb," Third... Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claim to dominion of the North. From this time, till the end of time, we are a free and independent kingdom.",1,2,30
233,robb, m,robb," Neither Joffrey nor any of his men shall set foot in our lands again. If he disregards this command, he shall suffer the same fate as my father, only I don't need a servant to do my beheading for me.",1,2,40
234,robb, m,robb," These are my terms. If the Queen Regent and her son meet them, I'll give them peace. If not, I will litter the south with Lannister dead.",1,2,27
235,robb, m,robb," Oh, is he? You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton. That will be all for tonight.",1,2,15
236,robb, m,robb, You don't have to call me ‘Your Grace’ when no one's around.,1,2,12
237,robb, m,robb, I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.,1,2,7
238,robb, m,robb, Of course they are.,1,2,4
239,robb, m,robb, Men who fought my father.,1,2,5
240,robb, m,robb, I need his ships. They say he has 200.,1,2,9
241,robb, m,robb, I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.,1,2,7
242,robb, m,robb," Yes. And now I'm the one rebelling against the throne. Before me, it was father. You married one rebel and mothered another.",1,2,22
243,robb, m,robb," If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls, my bannermen will string me up by my feet.",1,2,17
244,robb, m,robb, It's more complicated than that! You know it is.,1,2,9
245,robb, m,robb, You can't go to Winterfell.,1,2,5
246,robb, m,robb," I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys, ‘cause tomorrow, you'll ride south to the Stormlands.",1,2,16
247,robb, m,robb," Because I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon. He's rallied an army of 100,000. You know him. You know his family.",1,2,22
248,robb, m,robb," Which of these lords do I trust more than you? If Renly sides with us, we'll outnumber them two to one. When they feel the jaws beginning to shut, they'll sue for peace. We'll get the girls back. Then we'll all go home for good.",1,2,45
249,robb, m,robb," We will all be together again soon, I promise.",1,2,9
250,robb, m,robb, (Pauses) Give Lord Renly my regards.,1,2,6
251,robb, m,robb," We're not executing prisoners, Lord Bolton.",4,2,6
252,robb, m,robb, I doubt it.,4,2,3
253,robb, m,robb, My father outlawed flaying in the North.,4,2,7
254,robb, m,robb, We're not torturing them.,4,2,4
255,robb, m,robb, The Lannisters hold prisoners of their own. I won't give them an excuse to abuse my sisters.,4,2,17
256,robb, m,robb, You'll die if she doesn't.,4,2,5
257,robb, m,robb, Put this in your mouth and lie down. You don't want to watch.,4,2,13
258,robb, m,robb," Bite on it. It's better than biting your own tongue, believe me.",4,2,12
259,robb, m,robb, What's your name?,4,2,3
260,robb, m,robb, Your last name?,4,2,3
261,robb, m,robb, You know my family name. You have me at a disadvantage.,4,2,11
262,robb, m,robb, They killed my father.,4,2,4
263,robb, m,robb, The family he fights for.,4,2,5
264,robb, m,robb, I have no hatred for the lad.,4,2,7
265,robb, m,robb," You'd have us surrender, end all this bloodshed. I understand. The country would be at peace and life would be just under the righteous hand of good King Joffrey.",4,2,29
266,robb, m,robb, If the gods give me strength.,4,2,6
267,robb, m,robb,  I don't know. We'll go back to Winterfell. I have no desire to sit on the Iron Throne.,4,2,18
268,robb, m,robb,  I don't know.,4,2,3
269,robb, m,robb, First we have to win the war.,4,2,7
270,robb, m,robb, You never told me where you're from.,4,2,7
271,robb, m,robb,  Volantis? You're far from home. The boy was lucky you were here.,4,2,12
272,robb, m,robb, Quent.,6,2,1
273,robb, m,robb, Lady Talisa.,6,2,2
274,robb, m,robb, I'm not sure I'm a lady.,6,2,6
275,robb, m,robb," It's hard to keep all the rules straight. But if I remember my lessons, a woman of noble birth is always called a lady. Unless she's a queen or a princess. I could find someone who knows.",6,2,37
276,robb, m,robb, Because it's obvious.,6,2,3
277,robb, m,robb, I'd call you a liar.,6,2,5
278,robb, m,robb, (nods),6,2,1
279,robb, m,robb," Better at amputations, I'm afraid.",6,2,5
280,robb, m,robb, Quite a pretty spot.,6,2,4
281,robb, m,robb, I couldn't really discuss troop movements with you.,6,2,8
282,robb, m,robb," Of course, a spy would deny being a spy.",6,2,9
283,robb, m,robb," Mother. Mother, this is Lady Talisa. She's been helping with the wounded. She's been very helpful.",6,2,16
284,robb, m,robb, I've missed you.,6,2,3
285,robb, m,robb," You surprised me, that's all. I didn't think I'd see you today.",6,2,12
286,robb, m,robb, I know.,6,2,2
287,robb, m,robb,  I know.,6,2,2
288,robb, m,robb, I haven't forgotten.,6,2,3
289,robb, m,robb, This cannot be true.,6,2,4
290,robb, m,robb, Why? Why would Theon,6,2,4
291,robb, m,robb, My brothers?,6,2,2
292,robb, m,robb, I must go north at once.,6,2,6
293,robb, m,robb, How can I call myself king if I can't hold my own castle? How can I ask men to follow me if I can't,6,2,24
294,robb, m,robb, There will be no talk. He will die for this.,6,2,10
295,robb, m,robb," Tell your son Bran and Rickon's safety is paramount. And Theon, I want him brought to me alive. I want to look him in the eye and ask him why. And then I'll take his head myself.",6,2,37
296,robb, m,robb, And what did she say?,7,2,5
297,robb, m,robb, And what then?,7,2,3
298,robb, m,robb," If every man were held accountable for the actions of every distant relative, Ser Alton, we'd all hang.",7,2,18
299,robb, m,robb," You've acted with honor. I thank you for it. Lord Karstark, see that Ser Alton's pen is clean, and give him a hot supper.",7,2,24
300,robb, m,robb, Is there room for Ser Alton?,7,2,6
301,robb, m,robb, Have the men build him a new pen. Put him in with the Kingslayer for now. Have your boy watch over them.,7,2,22
302,robb, m,robb, That will be all.,7,2,4
303,robb, m,robb," And my enemies, as some of my bannermen are fond of mentioning.",7,2,12
304,robb, m,robb, That's what I tell my bannermen.,7,2,6
305,robb, m,robb,  If you need help finding these,7,2,6
306,robb, m,robb," Continue, my lady.",7,2,3

312,robb, m,robb,  lt's a birthday message to his grand-niece Walda.,9,1,8
313,robb, m,robb,  He's Grandfather's bannerman. We can't expect his support?,9,1,8
314,robb, m,robb,  Father rots in a dungeon. How long before they take his head? We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now.,9,1,25
315,robb, m,robb,  Have my horse saddled and ready.,9,1,6
316,robb, m,robb,"  My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing. Whatever it took. lf l'm going to lead this army, l can't have other men doing my bargaining for me.",9,1,31
317,robb, m,robb,  Well? What did he say?,9,1,5
318,robb, m,robb,  Huh.,9,1,1
319,robb, m,robb,  What does he want in return?,9,1,6

329,robb, m,robb,"  l sent 2,000 men to their graves today.",9,1,8
330,robb, m,robb,  Aye. But the dead won't hear them. (making a speech to his bannermen) One victory does not make us conquerors. Did we free my father? Did we rescue my sisters from the queen? Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees? This war is far from over.,9,1,52
331,robb, m,robb,  Treason? Sansa wrote this?,8,1,4
332,robb, m,robb,"  Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his ass kissed?",8,1,12

449,stannis, m,stannis, My enemies think they've destroyed me. They're laughing at me the way Renly laughed at me. I want Joffrey dead. I want Robb Stark dead. Make me another son.,3,3,29
450,stannis, m,stannis, Why?,3,3,1

481,stannis, m,stannis, Very well. *to Davos* Take him.,10,4,6
482,stannis, m,stannis, You're a literary man now. What do you make of that?,3,4,11
483,stannis, m,stannis, The usurper Joffrey Baratheon. I said those words when I tossed a leech into the fire. A leech filled with bastard blood. A bastard you set free. I am now faced with a great opportunity and I am powerless to take advantage of it.,3,4,44

511,stannis, m,stannis, Horses?,9,5,1
512,stannis, m,stannis, 20 men rode into our camp without a single guard sounding the alarm?,9,5,13

527,stannis, m,stannis," Sometimes a person has to choose. Sometimes the world forces his hand. If a man knows what he is and remains true to himself, the choice is not choice at all. He must fulfill his destiny and become who he is meant to be. However much he may hate it.",9,5,50

551,stannis, m,stannis, I know it. We march on Winterfell within the fortnight. Before the snows trap us here.,3,5,16
552,stannis, m,stannis," They'd rather burn than fight for me, so be it. I leave their fate to you. You could execute them, that's the safest course. (After a moment). Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was. I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch would rather see the wildlings dead.",3,5,58
553,stannis, m,stannis, You're the Lord Commander. Your decision.,3,5,6
554,stannis, m,stannis, You have many enemies in Castle Black. Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere? Give him command of  Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.,3,5,19
555,stannis, m,stannis, Whoever said that didn't have many enemies.,3,5,7
556,stannis, m,stannis," I ordered Mance Rayder burnt at the stake. You prevented that order from being carried out. You showed mercy to Mance Rayder. A king's word is law. Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos how much mercy I show to lawbreakers. Show too much kindness, people won't fear you. If people don't fear you, they don't follow you.",2,5,57
557,stannis, m,stannis, Who then? You?,2,5,3
558,stannis, m,stannis, Do you know this wretched girl Lyanna Mormont?,2,5,8

564,stannis, m,stannis, You know who rules at Winterfell now?,1,5,7
565,stannis, m,stannis, The traitor who plunged a dagger into Robb Stark’s heart. Don’t you want to avenge him?,1,5,16
566,stannis, m,stannis, No matter. I shall take back the North from the thieves who stole it. Tywin Lannister is dead. He can’t protect them now. I shall mount Roose Bolton’s head on a spike. But if I’m to take Winterfell I’ll need more men.,1,5,42
567,stannis, m,stannis, I’m not talking about the damn Night’s Watch. I’m talking about the wildlings.,1,5,13
568,stannis, m,stannis," If they swear to follow me, I’ll pardon them. We’ll take Winterfell. Once the North is won, I’ll declare them citizens of the realm. I’ll give them land to live on.",1,5,31

579,stannis, m,stannis," Your father is Randyll Tarly. He defeated my brother at the Battle of Ashford. Only battle Robert ever lost. I told him he shouldn't go so far west so soon, but he never listened. Fine soldier, your father. You don't look like a soldier. But I'm told you killed a white walker.",5,5,52
580,stannis, m,stannis, How?,5,5,1
581,stannis, m,stannis, Dragonglass?,5,5,1
582,stannis, m,stannis, I know what it is. We have it in Dragonstone. Why would obsidian kill a walker?,5,5,16
583,stannis, m,stannis, The Lady Melisandre told me that death marches on the Wall.,5,5,11

587,stannis, m,stannis," If Jon Snow returns with the wildlings. We can't wait that long. We have the advantage, more men, more horses, all fed and rested. But every day we wait, the odds shift in Bolton's favor. This could turn to winter at any moment. We have to act now. Give the order. We march at sunrise.",5,5,55
588,stannis, m,stannis," No need, they're coming with us.",5,5,6
589,stannis, m,stannis," Here? Half these watchmen are killers and rapists. No, they march with us.",5,5,13
590,stannis, m,stannis, I hope you know what you're doing with these wildlings. I need those ships.,5,5,14
591,stannis, m,stannis, Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.,4,5,6
592,stannis, m,stannis," Perhaps, but that wasn't Ned Stark's way.",4,5,7
593,stannis, m,stannis, Not your fault.,4,5,3
594,stannis, m,stannis, We must. To beat the snows.,4,5,6
595,stannis, m,stannis, I won't. I need you.,4,5,5
596,stannis, m,stannis," (Walking away). And you, my Lady, what do you need?",4,5,10

600,stannis, m,stannis, Why do you say that?,4,5,5
601,stannis, m,stannis, She shouldn't have said that.,4,5,5
602,stannis, m,stannis," When you were an infant, (Stands up and walks around his desk), the Dornish trailer landed on Dragonstone. His goods were junk except for one wooden doll. He'd even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our House. No doubt he'd heard of your birth, and assumed new fathers were easy targets. I still remember how you smiled when I put that doll in your cradle, (Shireen smiles), and you pressed it to your cheek. (Looks down. Shireen’s smile drops). By the time we burnt the doll, it was too late. (Walks to the table and adjusts the objects on it). I was told you would die. Or worse, the grayscale would go slow. (Turns to her). Let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you. Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria to live out your short life with the Stone men, before the sickness spread to the castle. I told them all to go to hell. (Shireen smiles). I called in every maester on this side of the world. Every healer, every apothecary. They stopped the disease and saved your life. Because you did not belong across the world with the bloody Stone men. (Walks towards her). You are the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon. And you are my daughter.",4,5,224

636,stannis, m,stannis,  No? Robert did. He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war. Renly never fought a day in his life.,8,2,20
637,stannis, m,stannis,  Then why'd he give him Storm's End?,8,2,7
638,stannis, m,stannis," First, we ate the horses. We weren't riding anywhere, not with the castle surrounded. We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses. Then the cats. Never liked cats. So fine. I do like dogs. Good animals. Loyal. But we ate them. Then the rats. The night before you slipped through, I thought my wife was dying. She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail. And then you made it through the lines. Slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions.",8,2,83
639,stannis, m,stannis,  Every man in Storm's End wanted to kiss you that night.,8,2,11
640,stannis, m,stannis," Robert told me to hold Storm's End, so I held it. Then he told me he was giving it to Renly, so I gave it up. Insult or no, I gave it up. Because Robert was my older brother, and he was the king and I've always done my duty. But now, I'm the rightful king by every law of Westeros. And when I sit the Iron Throne, you'll be my Hand.",8,2,72

642,stannis, m,stannis, You said you saw my victory in the flames.,10,2,9
643,stannis, m,stannis,"  The flames lied. And I'm no better than a savage trusting in a fire god. I fought for your god in Blackwater Bay. I led my men to the gates of the seventh hell as their brothers burned alive, and for what? Attacked from behind by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells. If you see so much in your flames, why didn't you warn me?",10,2,64

655,stannis, m,stannis," In my experience, pirates prefer fighting unarmed men.",2,2,8

When the king was visiting the Nightfort, the cook killed the king's son, cooked him into a big pie with onions, carrots, mushrooms and bacon. That night he served the pie to the king. He liked the taste of his son so much, he asked for a second slice. The gods turned the cook into a giant white rat who could only eat his own young. He's been roaming the Nightfort ever since, devouring his own babies. But no matter what he does, he's always hungry.",10,3,104
745,bran, m,bran, It wasn't for murder the gods cursed the Rat Cook or for serving the king's son in a pie. He killed a guest beneath his roof. That's something the gods can't forgive.,10,3,32

909,bran, m,bran,  For helping me.,4,7,3
910,bran, m,bran,"  I'm not really, not anymore.  I remember what it felt like to be Brandon Stark, but I remember so much else now.",4,7,22
911,bran, m,bran,  You came home.,4,7,3
912,bran, m,bran,  I saw you at the crossroads.,4,7,6
913,bran, m,bran,  I see quite a lot now.,4,7,6
914,bran, m,bran,  I thought you might go to King's Landing.,4,7,8
915,bran, m,bran,  Cersei is on her list of names.,4,7,7
916,bran, m,bran,  Littlefinger gave it to me.,4,7,5
917,bran, m,bran,  He thought I'd want it.,4,7,5
918,bran, m,bran,  Because it was meant to kill me.,4,7,7
919,bran, m,bran,  Someone very wealthy wanted me dead.,4,7,6
920,bran, m,bran,  It doesn't matter.,4,7,3
921,bran, m,bran,  I don't want it.,4,7,4
922,bran, m,bran,  It's wasted on a cripple.,4,7,5
923,bran, m,bran, You held a knife to his throat.,7,7,7
924,bran, m,bran," You said, ""I did warn you not the trust me.""",7,7,10
925,bran, m,bran, Come in.,7,7,2
926,bran, m,bran, Samwell Tarly.,7,7,2
927,bran, m,bran, I remember everything.,7,7,3
928,bran, m,bran, You helped us get beyond the Wall. You're a good man.,7,7,11
929,bran, m,bran, I became the Three-Eyed Raven.,7,7,5
930,bran, m,bran, I can see things that happened in the past. I can see things happening now all over the world. Why did you come to Winterfell?,7,7,25
931,bran, m,bran, He's on his way back to Winterfell with Daenerys Targaryen. You you saw this  in a vision?,7,7,17
932,bran, m,bran, He needs to know the truth.,7,7,6
933,bran, m,bran, About himself. No one knows. No one but me. Jon isn't really my father's son He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and my aunt.,7,7,24
934,bran, m,bran, Dornish bastards are named Sand.,7,7,5
935,bran, m,bran, Are you certain?,7,7,3
936,bran, m,bran, Robert's Rebellion was built on a lie. Rhaegar didn't kidnap my aunt.,7,7,12
937,bran, m,bran, He loved her. And she loved him.,7,7,7
938,bran, m,bran, He's never been a bastard.,7,7,5
939,bran, m,bran, The things we do for love.,2,8,6
940,bran, m,bran, You weren't sorry then. You were protecting your family.,2,8,9
941,bran, m,bran," You still would be, if you hadn't pushed me out of that window. And I would still be Brandon Stark.",2,8,20
942,bran, m,bran, No. I'm something else now.,2,8,5
943,bran, m,bran, I'm not angry at anyone.,2,8,5
944,bran, m,bran, You won't be able to help us in this fight if I let them murder you first.,2,8,17
945,bran, m,bran, How do you know there is an afterwards?,2,8,8
946,bran, m,bran," Yes, he will.",2,8,3
947,bran, m,bran," He'll come for me. He's tried before, many times, with many Three-Eyed Ravens.",2,8,13
948,bran, m,bran," An endless night. He wants to erase this world, and I am its memory.",2,8,14
949,bran, m,bran, His mark is on me.,2,8,5
950,bran, m,bran, He always knows where I am.,2,8,6
951,bran, m,bran, No. We need to lure him into the open before his army destroys us all. I'll wait for him in the Godswood.,2,8,22
952,bran, m,bran, I don't know. No one's ever tried.,2,8,7
953,bran, m,bran, No.,2,8,1
954,bran, m,bran, Stranger than most.,2,8,3
955,bran, m,bran, It's a long story.,2,8,4
956,bran, m,bran, Almost.,1,8,1
957,bran, m,bran, We don't have time for all this. The Night King has your dragon.,1,8,13
958,bran, m,bran," He's one of them now. The Wall has fallen, the dead march south.",1,8,13
959,bran, m,bran," Waiting, for an old friend. It's time to tell Jon the truth.",1,8,12
960,bran, m,bran, I'm not his brother. He trusts you more than anyone. Now's the time.,1,8,13
961,bran, m,bran, It's the same as the one Daeron Targaryen built for his crippled nephew 120 years ago. I liked that one.,4,8,20
962,bran, m,bran, I'm not Lord of Winterfell.,4,8,5
963,bran, m,bran, I don't really want anymore.,4,8,5
964,bran, m,bran, You shouldn't envy me. Mostly I live in the past.,4,8,10
965,bran, m,bran, It's your choice.,4,8,3
966,bran, m,bran, Why do you think I came all this way?,6,8,9
967,bran, m,bran, Lord Tyrion you will be my Hand.,6,8,7
968,bran, m,bran, And I don't want to be king.,6,8,7
969,bran, m,bran,  I choose you.,6,8,3
970,bran, m,bran," Yes, I can. I'm king.",6,8,5
971,bran, m,bran, He just got it. He's made many terrible mistakes. He's going to spend the rest of his life fixing them.,6,8,20
972,bran, m,bran, You were exactly where you were supposed to be.,6,8,9
973,bran, m,bran, We appear to be missing a Master of Whisperers. And a Master of Laws. And a Master of War.,6,8,19
974,bran, m,bran, And Drogon? Any word?,6,8,4
975,bran, m,bran, Perhaps I can find him. Do carry on with the rest.,6,8,11
976,bran, m,bran, (smiling) I'm sure it will.,6,8,5
977,bran, m,bran,"  lt had three eyes. lt told me to come with him, so l did. We went down into the crypts and my father was there.",10,1,25
978,bran, m,bran,  You're afraid. Just like Hodor.,10,1,5
979,bran, m,bran,  You've lived beyond the Wall. What are you scared of? l'm a crippled boy and l'm willing to go.,10,1,19
980,bran, m,bran,"  That's my grandfather, Lord Rickard. He was burned alive by the Mad King, Aerys. That's Lyanna, my father's sister. King Robert was supposed to marry her, but Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped her. Robert started a war to win her back. He killed Rhaegar, but she died anyway. That's where l saw Father.",10,1,51
981,bran, m,bran,  Rickon!,10,1,1
982,bran, m,bran,  What are you doing down here? Come back up with us.,10,1,11
983,bran, m,bran,  How many times have l told you? He's in King's Landing with Sansa and Arya.,10,1,15
984,bran, m,bran,  Saw him when?,10,1,3
985,bran, m,bran,  I hate your stories.,3,1,4
986,bran, m,bran, Those weren't my favorites. My favorites were the scary ones.,3,1,10
987,bran, m,bran,  Maybe we do.,3,1,3
988,bran, m,bran,"  I did though. It's true, isn't it... what Maester Luwin says about my legs? I'd rather be dead.",3,1,18
989,bran, m,bran, I'd rather be dead.,3,1,4
990,bran, m,bran, Jon said he was a deserter.,1,1,6
991,bran, m,bran, Our way is the old way?,1,1,6
992,bran, m,bran, Is it true he saw the White Walkers?,1,1,8
993,bran, m,bran, So he was lying?,1,1,4
994,bran, m,bran, Where will they go? Their mother’s dead.,1,1,7
995,bran, m,bran, NO!,1,1,1
996,bran, m,bran," Please, father!",1,1,2
997,bran, m,bran, What about you?,1,1,3
998,bran, m,bran, I saw the king! He’s got hundreds of people!,1,1,9
999,bran, m,bran, But he’s coming right now! Down our road!,1,1,8
1000,bran, m,bran, I promise.,1,1,2
1001,bran, m,bran, What?,1,1,1
1002,bran, m,bran," Come on, you.",1,1,3
1003,bran, m,bran, Ten,1,1,1
1004,bran, m,bran, The Greyjoys.,5,1,2

1010,bran, m,bran, Family comes first?,5,1,3
1011,bran, m,bran," How can she protect the family, if she's not with her family?",5,1,12
1012,bran, m,bran, And then she left!,5,1,4
1013,bran, m,bran, Why did she leave?,5,1,4
1014,bran, m,bran, Do you know where she is now? Today?,5,1,8
1015,bran, m,bran, Then how can you promise me she'll be home soon?,5,1,10
1016,bran, m,bran, I'll never shoot another arrow.,5,1,5
1017,bran, m,bran, You need legs to work a bow.,5,1,7
1018,bran, m,bran, Really?,5,1,1
1019,bran, m,bran, I don't want to see anyone.,4,1,6
1020,bran, m,bran, I don't want to go.,4,1,5
1021,bran, m,bran," Kneel, Hodor.",4,1,2
1022,bran, m,bran," Yes. Well, I mean I did like to.",4,1,8
1023,bran, m,bran, I'm not a cripple.,4,1,4
1024,bran, m,bran, Will I really be able to ride?,4,1,7
1025,bran, m,bran," Come on, Dancer. (to his horse)",6,1,6
1026,bran, m,bran, Robb?,6,1,1
1027,bran, m,bran," I’m not alone, my brother is with me.",6,1,8
1028,bran, m,bran," I can’t. The saddle, the straps.",6,1,6
1029,bran, m,bran," I’m Brandon Stark of Winterfell and if you don’t let me be, I’ll have you all killed!",6,1,17

1032,bran, m,bran," Yes, it doesn’t hurt.",6,1,4
1033,bran, m,bran," Thank you, Uncle Benjen.",10,6,4
1034,bran, m,bran,I’m the Three-Eyed Raven now. I have to be ready for this.,10,6,12
1035,bran, m,bran, That’s my father.,3,6,3
1036,bran, m,bran, Ser Arthur Dayne.,3,6,3
1037,bran, m,bran, Father said he was the best swordsman he ever saw.,3,6,10
1038,bran, m,bran, He’s better than my father.,3,6,5
1039,bran, m,bran, But Father beat him.,3,6,4
1040,bran, m,bran, I know he did. Heard the story a thousand times.,3,6,10
1041,bran, m,bran, He stabbed him in the back.,3,6,6
1042,bran, m,bran, What’s in the tower?,3,6,4
1043,bran, m,bran, I want to see where he’s going.,3,6,7
1044,bran, m,bran, Father!,3,6,1
1045,bran, m,bran, Why did you do that? Take me back there. I want to go back.,3,6,14
1046,bran, m,bran, He heard me.,3,6,3
1047,bran, m,bran, He heard me.,3,6,3
1048,bran, m,bran, What’s in that tower? I want to go back there.,3,6,10
1049,bran, m,bran, Why do I want to return? So I can be a cripple again? So I can talk to an old man in a tree?,3,6,24
1050,bran, m,bran, So why did you?,3,6,4
1051,bran, m,bran, I don’t want to be you.,3,6,6
1052,bran, m,bran, Learn what?,3,6,2
1053,bran, m,bran, That’s my father. And my Uncle Benjen.,2,6,7
1054,bran, m,bran, They were all so happy.,2,6,5
1055,bran, m,bran, My Aunt Lyanna. I’ve seen her statue in the crypt. My father never talked about her.,2,6,16
1056,bran, m,bran, Hodor?,2,6,1
1057,bran, m,bran, Hodor talks?,2,6,2
1058,bran, m,bran," Please, a little longer.",2,6,4
1059,bran, m,bran, You finally show me something I care about and then you drag me away.,2,6,14
1060,bran, m,bran, I wasn’t drowning. I was home.,2,6,6
1061,bran, m,bran, Wylis.,2,6,1
1062,bran, m,bran, I saw you as a boy. You could talk. What happened?,2,6,11
1063,bran, m,bran, Where’s Meera?,2,6,2
1064,bran, m,bran, You shouldn’t be here. It’s not safe outside the cave.,2,6,10
1065,bran, m,bran, I saw that Hodor wasn’t always Hodor.,2,6,7
1066,bran, m,bran, What’s wrong?,2,6,2
1067,bran, m,bran, The Three-Eyed Raven says there’s a war coming.,2,6,8
1068,bran, m,bran, It was you. You made the White Walkers.,5,6,8
1069,bran, m,bran, From whom?,5,6,2
1070,bran, m,bran, What?,5,6,1
1071,bran, m,bran," He saw me, the Night King! He saw me!",5,6,9
1072,bran, m,bran," I don’t know. He was close, but --",5,6,8
1073,bran, m,bran, But he can’t get in.,5,6,5
1074,bran, m,bran, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to.,5,6,6
1075,bran, m,bran, The time for what?,5,6,4
1076,bran, m,bran, But am I ready?,5,6,4
1077,bran, m,bran, Meera. They found us.,6,6,4
1078,bran, m,bran, Who are you?,6,6,3
1079,bran, m,bran, Uncle Benjen. The last letter Jon wrote me said you had been lost beyond the Wall.,6,6,16
1080,bran, m,bran, How?,6,6,1
1081,bran, m,bran, Dragonglass. A shard of dragonglass plunged into your heart.,6,6,9
1082,bran, m,bran, I didn’t have time to learn. I can’t control anything.,6,6,10
1083,roose, m,roose," Never do, my lady.  Dulls the senses.",9,3,7
1084,roose, m,roose," Aye.  Lord Walder let me choose any of his granddaughters and promised me the girl’s weight in silver as a dowry.  So I have a fat, young bride.",9,3,28
1085,roose, m,roose," Well, she’s made me very rich.",9,3,6
1086,roose, m,roose, Every bride suffers the same.  I’m sure you endured yours with grace.,9,3,12
1087,roose, m,roose, The Lannisters send their regards.,9,3,5
1088,roose, m,roose, The Blackfish escaped.,10,3,3
1089,roose, m,roose, As you say.,10,3,3
1090,roose, m,roose, You'll be needing a new young girl.,10,3,7
1091,roose, m,roose, (grunts),10,3,1
1092,roose, m,roose, He ignored my advice at every turn. If he'd been a trifle less arrogant--,10,3,14
1093,roose, m,roose, (nods),10,3,1
1094,roose, m,roose, Forever young.,10,3,2
1095,roose, m,roose, At some point perhaps. But Winterfell's in ruins.,10,3,8
1096,roose, m,roose, I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out.  Robb Stark offered amnesty for the ironborn if they gave us Theon.,10,3,21
1097,roose, m,roose," We should set the siege lines 1,000 yards from Harrenhal.",1,3,10
1098,roose, m,roose, I imagine the Mountain will defend whatever Tywin Lannister tells him to defend.,1,3,13
1099,roose, m,roose," The debt will be repaid, my friend. For them and for your sons.",1,3,13
1100,roose, m,roose, The Kingslayer won't remain free for long. My best hunters are after him.,1,3,13
1101,roose, m,roose, Ser Jaime isn't well. Take him to Qyburn.,5,3,8
1102,roose, m,roose, I see my men have finally found you something appropriate to wear.,6,3,12
1103,roose, m,roose, I should send you back to Robb Stark.,6,3,8
1104,roose, m,roose, Wars cost money. Many people would pay a great deal for you.,6,3,12
1105,roose, m,roose, You're right. Perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies.,6,3,17
1106,roose, m,roose, King Robb is keeping your father quite busy. He doesn't have time for anything else.,6,3,15
1107,roose, m,roose," As soon as you're well enough to travel, I will allow you to go to King's Landing as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made. And you will swear to tell your father the truth, that I had nothing to do with your maiming.",6,3,44
1108,roose, m,roose, I don't partake.,6,3,3
1109,roose, m,roose," Oh, she won't be going with you.",6,3,7
1110,roose, m,roose, You are charged with abetting treason.,6,3,6
1111,roose, m,roose, You're in no place to insist on anything. I would have hoped you'd learned your lesson about overplaying your position.,6,3,20
1112,roose, m,roose," Not nothing. The North. Ride 700 miles that way, you're still in the North. 400 miles that way. 300 miles that way. The North is larger than the other six kingdoms combined. And I am the Warden of the North. The North is mine. Now tell me, what is your name?",8,4,51
1113,roose, m,roose," No, not Ramsay Snow. *hands Ramsay a scroll* Open it. From this day until your last day, you are Ramsay Bolton, son of Roose Bolton, Warden of the North.",8,4,29
1114,roose, m,roose," Walda, this is Ramsay Snow, my bastard.",2,4,7
1115,roose, m,roose," See that the horses are fed, watered, and rubbed down. And take Lady Walda to her chambers.",2,4,17
1116,roose, m,roose, Where is your prize?,2,4,4
1117,roose, m,roose, What did you do to him?,2,4,6
1118,roose, m,roose, You flayed him.,2,4,3
1119,roose, m,roose, This was Balon Greyjoy's son and heir.,2,4,7
1120,roose, m,roose," My banners, not yours. You're not a Bolton. You're a Snow. Tywin Lannister has given me the North. But he won't lift a finger to help me take it. As long as the ironborn hold Moat Cailin, our armies are trapped south of the Neck. Theon was a valuable hostage, not your plaything. I wanted to trade him for Moat Cailin.",2,4,61
1121,roose, m,roose, You sent terms to Balon Greyjoy without my consent?,2,4,9
1122,roose, m,roose, I had to smuggle myself into my own lands thanks to the Greyjoys. I needed Theon. I needed him whole.,2,4,20
1123,roose, m,roose, I placed far too much trust in you.,2,4,8
1124,roose, m,roose, You murdered them and displayed their corpses at Winterfell.,2,4,9
1125,roose, m,roose, You ready for a hunt?,2,4,5
1126,roose, m,roose, Their bastard brother. He could be sheltering them. He may know where they are.,2,4,14
1127,roose, m,roose," You want to prove yourself a Bolton? Gather whatever men you can and ride for Moat Cailin. Bring this creature of yours. Maybe he'll be of some use. Take the Moat for the family, for our family, and I'll reconsider your position.",2,4,42
1128,roose, m,roose," And how high can Stannis’ horses jump? Our walls have been full repaired our walls have been reinforced. We have enough food for six months. We are more prepared for a siege than they could have ever been. All we have to do is wait for them to freeze, starve, and mutiny.",8,5,52
1129,roose, m,roose, You disagree?,8,5,2
1130,roose, m,roose, And what do you recommend?,8,5,5
1131,roose, m,roose, A smart commander does not surrender a defensive advantage. As long as we stay behind these walls they can’t touch us. Not to mention that the snow is so deep that we couldn’t get an army through if we wanted to.,8,5,41
1132,roose, m,roose, We can't hold the North with terror alone.,3,5,8
1133,roose, m,roose," I sent you there to collect taxes, not bodies.",3,5,9
1134,roose, m,roose, He left you no choice.,3,5,5
1135,roose, m,roose, And?,3,5,1
1136,roose, m,roose, (After a moment). I have something important to tell you. Stop eating and listen.,3,5,14
1137,roose, m,roose, We don't have enough men to hold the North if the other Houses rise up against us. Do you understand that?,3,5,21
1138,roose, m,roose," I had a pact with Tywin Lannister, and Tywin Lannister is dead. The remaining Lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact. They've never once in the history of the Seven Kingdoms sent their army this far north. If you think they will for us, you're a fool. We become a great house by entering in alliances with other houses, and parleying those alliances into greater power. The best way to forge a lasting alliance isn't by peeling a man's skin off. The best way is marriage. (Stands up). Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree, it's time you married a suitable bride. And as it happens, I found the perfect girl to solidify our hold in the North.",3,5,122
1139,roose, m,roose," Lady Sansa, welcome.",3,5,3
1140,roose, m,roose," May I introduce my son, (Stands aside), Ramsay Bolton?",3,5,9
1141,roose, m,roose, (Approaching). And you're not anymore. Allow me a moment alone with Lord Baelish.,3,5,13
1142,roose, m,roose, Shouldn't he be?,3,5,3
1143,roose, m,roose," I leave that to the brothel keeper. It's her name I need, not her virtue.",3,5,15
1144,roose, m,roose, And you prepared for the consequences. When the Lannisters hear I've wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay.,3,5,16
1145,roose, m,roose, The Queen will be enraged.,3,5,5
1146,roose, m,roose," And yet she still has friends. Men in important places, whom she can ask for favours. (They stop, and Roose holds up a letter). A message for you, from Cersei Lannister. A rider arrived from Eyrie, shortly before dawn. Apparently, she thinks you're still in the Vale.",3,5,47
1147,roose, m,roose," I'm sure you understand my position, Lord Baelish. If you received word in the night from the Queen Mother, it does make me question our new alliance. The Lannisters made you one of the great lords of Westeros. Yet, here you are in the North, undermining them. Why gamble with your position?",3,5,52
1148,roose, m,roose, I had Tywin Lannister backing. Who supports me now? You?,3,5,10
1149,roose, m,roose, I'd like to read the reply.,3,5,6
1150,roose, m,roose," I trust you find your chamber suitable, my lady.",5,5,9
1151,roose, m,roose, (Raises his cup). To your wedding.,5,5,6
1152,roose, m,roose," Yes, yes, very good.",5,5,4
1153,roose, m,roose," Walda and I have some good news as well, since we're all together.",5,5,13
1154,roose, m,roose," From the way she's carrying, Maester Wolkan says it looks like a boy.",5,5,13
1155,roose, m,roose, Sure of what?,5,5,3
1156,roose, m,roose, Maester Wolkan has assured us beyond all doubt.,5,5,8
1157,roose, m,roose, Manage what?,5,5,2
1158,roose, m,roose, I imagine you're familiar with the procedure.,5,5,7
1159,roose, m,roose," You disgraced yourself at dinner, parading that creature before the Stark girl.",5,5,12
1160,roose, m,roose, You're worried about your position.,5,5,5
1161,roose, m,roose, You've never asked me about your mother.,5,5,7
1162,roose, m,roose," She was a peasant girl. Pretty in a common sort of way. She was the miller's wife. Apparently they had married without my knowledge or consent. So I had him hanged and I took her beneath the tree where he was swaying. She fought me the whole time. She was lucky I didn't hang her, too. A year later she came to my gates with a squalling baby in her arms. A baby she claimed was mine. I nearly had her whipped and the child thrown in the river. (Stands up). But then I looked at you and I saw then what I see now. You are my son. (After a moment). Stannis Baratheon has an army at Castle Black. But he won't stay for long. He wants the Iron Throne, and the road to King's Landing comes right through Winterfell. He means to take the North. But the North is ours. It's yours and mine. Will you help me defeat him?",5,5,162
1163,roose, m,roose, Who comes before the Old Gods this night?,6,5,8
1164,roose, m,roose," Lady Sansa, will you take this man?",6,5,7
1165,roose, m,roose, We've sent a dozen ravens. None have returned. My bastard is only a few days from Winterfell. Once he captures the castle,8,2,22
1166,roose, m,roose, He wouldn't dare hurt the boys. They're his only hope of escaping the North with his head.,8,2,17
1167,roose, m,roose," A touch of mercy is a virtue, Your Grace. Too much",8,2,11
1168,roose, m,roose, I expect his countrymen will turn on him the minute they hear the offer.,8,2,14
1169,roose, m,roose, My lady.,8,2,2
1170,roose, m,roose, Five Lannisters dead for every one of ours. They're dead. Take everything they've got. We've nowhere to keep all these prisoners. Barely enough food to feed our own.,4,2,28
1171,roose, m,roose," Of course, Your Grace. The officers will be useful. Some of them may be privy to Tywin Lannister's plans.",4,2,19
1172,roose, m,roose," Well, we'll learn soon enough. In my family, we say, ""A naked man has few secrets. ""A flayed man none.""",4,2,20
1173,roose, m,roose, We're not in the North.,4,2,5
1174,roose, m,roose," The high road's very pretty, but you'll have a hard time marching your army down it.",4,2,16
1175,roose, m,roose, Surely one of our men needs your attention more than this cub.,4,2,12
1176,roose, m,roose, Your Grace. My lady. News from Winterfell.,6,2,7
1177,roose, m,roose," We've had ravens from White Harbor, Barrowton and the Dreadfort. I'm afraid it is true.",6,2,15
1178,roose, m,roose, Because the Greyjoys are treasonous whores.,6,2,6
1179,roose, m,roose,  We've heard nothing of them. But Rodrik Cassel is dead.,6,2,10
1180,roose, m,roose," There's still a war to win, Your Grace.",6,2,8
1181,roose, m,roose, You are a king. And that means you don't have to do everything yourself.,6,2,14
1182,roose, m,roose," Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew. Let me send word to my bastard at the Dreadfort. He can raise a few hundred men and retake Winterfell before the new moon. We have the Lannisters on the run. If you march all the way back north now, you'll lose what you gained. My boy would be honored to bring you Prince Theon's head.",6,2,64
1183,roose, m,roose, Too many prisoners.,7,2,3
1184,roose, m,roose, Half a dozen men? Your best hunters?,2,6,7
1185,roose, m,roose," I didn’t think lady Sansa killed them all by herself. Thank you for this report, Lord Kastark.",2,6,17
1186,roose, m,roose," Jon Snow is a bastard, not a Stark.",2,6,8
1187,roose, m,roose, Murder the Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch? You’d unite every house in the North against us.,2,6,17
1188,roose, m,roose," If you acquire a reputation as a mad dog, you’ll be treated as a mad dog. Taken out back and slaughtered for pig feed.",2,6,24
1189,roose, m,roose, You’ll always be my firstborn.,2,6,5
1190,roose, m,roose," Your command of the cavalry was impressive. Thanks to you, the false king Stannis Baratheon is dead. Do you know who struck the killing blow?",1,6,25
1191,roose, m,roose," A shame.  I’d reward the man.  Still, a great victory. Do you feel like a victor?",1,6,16
1192,roose, m,roose," I rebelled against the crown to arrange your marriage to Sansa Stark. Do you think that burning wagons in the night and mowing down tired, outnumbered Baratheons is the same as facing a prepared and provisioned Lannister army?",1,6,38
1193,roose, m,roose, A reckoning will come. We need the North to face it. The entire North. They won’t back us without Sansa Stark. We no longer have Sansa Stark. You played your games with her. You played your games with the heir to the Iron Islands and now they’re both gone.,1,6,49
1194,roose, m,roose," I’m glad to hear it. Without Sansa, you won’t be able to produce an heir. And without an heir, well…",1,6,20
1195,roose, m,roose, ...let’s hope the maesters are right and Lady Walder’s carrying a boy.,1,6,12
1196,daario, m,daario, There.,9,3,1
1197,daario, m,daario," There, it's a back gate.  My men use it when they visit Yunkai's bed slaves.",9,3,15
1198,daario, m,daario, I have no interest in slaves.  A man cannot make love to property.,9,3,13
1199,daario, m,daario," This is where we enter the city.  Very few guards, they know me.  They let me inside.",9,3,17
1200,daario, m,daario," I kill the guards.  I take your two best men and lead them through the back streets, which I know well, and open the front gates.",9,3,26
1201,daario, m,daario," Then comes the army.  Once the walls are breached, the city will fall in hours.",9,3,15
1202,daario, m,daario," You have a very suspicious mind.  In my experience, only dishonest people think this way.",9,3,15
1203,daario, m,daario," When you hear a songbird’s whistle, you come.  I’m a great whistler, the greatest in the land.",9,3,17
1204,daario, m,daario, Daario Naharis.,9,3,2
1205,daario, m,daario, That one was quick.,9,3,4
1206,daario, m,daario, I doubt it.  The Yunkish prefer to let their slaves do their fighting for them.,9,3,15
1207,daario, m,daario," The city is yours, my queen.",9,3,6
1208,daario, m,daario,  Daario Naharis,8,3,2
1209,daario, m,daario," I hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie. You have 8,000 Unsullied.",8,3,20
1210,daario, m,daario, You have no ships. You have no siege weapons. You have no cavalry.,8,3,13
1211,daario, m,daario, You talk too much.,8,3,4
1212,daario, m,daario, 8000 unsullied stand between her and your cock.,8,3,8
1213,daario, m,daario, She'll tell me whatever you pay her to tell me.,8,3,10
1214,daario, m,daario," I like them very much. I just refuse to pay them. And I'm no whore, my friend.",8,3,17
1215,daario, m,daario,  I fight for beauty.,8,3,4
1216,daario, m,daario, Do you hear me?  Follow my voice. I'm right here.,8,3,10
1217,daario, m,daario, You have something for me?,8,3,5
1218,daario, m,daario,  Valar morghulis.,8,3,2
1219,daario, m,daario, No screaming or she dies.,8,3,5
1220,daario, m,daario,  You.,8,3,1
1221,daario, m,daario," Don't scream, lovely girl.",8,3,4
1222,daario, m,daario, (nods and chuckles),8,3,3
1223,daario, m,daario,  I don't want to.,8,3,4
1224,daario, m,daario,  You should ask them.,8,3,4
1225,daario, m,daario,  We had philosophical differences.,8,3,4
1226,daario, m,daario,  Your beauty. It meant more to me than it did to them.,8,3,12
1227,daario, m,daario, I'm the simplest man you'll ever meet. I only do what I want to do.,8,3,15
1228,daario, m,daario,  Yes.,8,3,1
1229,daario, m,daario,  They ordered me to murder you. I told them I preferred not to. They told me I had no choice. I told them I am Daario Naharis. I always have a choice. They drew their swords and I drew mine.,8,3,40
1230,daario, m,daario, (nods),8,3,1
1231,daario, m,daario," The Second Sons are yours and so is Daario Naharis. My sword is yours, my life is yours, my heart is yours.",8,3,22
1232,daario, m,daario," I was the last to join your army. I'm not your general or a member of your Queensguard or the commander of your Unsullied. My mother was a whore. I come from nothing. And before long, I will return to nothing. Let me kill this man for you.",3,4,48
1233,daario, m,daario, Why would I want a horse?,3,4,6
1234,daario, m,daario, Horses are dumber than men.,3,4,5
1235,daario, m,daario, Ser Worm is stronger than he looks. But I can see his arms beginning to shake.,1,4,16
1236,daario, m,daario, The honor of riding by your side on the road to Meereen.,1,4,12
1237,daario, m,daario, (in valerian) You like this girl? Must be frustrating.,1,4,9
1238,daario, m,daario, (in valerian) I'd rather have no brains and two balls.,1,4,10
1239,daario, m,daario," Yes, my queen. But I need to speak to you about something important. A matter of strategy.",1,4,17
1240,daario, m,daario, A dusk rose.,1,4,3
1241,daario, m,daario, And this one's called lady's lace.,1,4,6
1242,daario, m,daario, Harpy's Gold. No tea from this one. Beautiful but poisonous.,1,4,10
1243,daario, m,daario, Your Grace.,1,4,2
1244,daario, m,daario, The Second Sons took the Meereenese Navy.,5,4,7
1245,daario, m,daario, No one.,5,4,2
1246,daario, m,daario, I heard you liked ships.,5,4,5
1247,daario, m,daario, but your window is not.,7,4,5
1248,daario, m,daario, I swam to an island a mile offshore for these.,7,4,10
1249,daario, m,daario, Never met a woman who didn't like wildflowers.,7,4,8
1250,daario, m,daario," Forgive me, my queen. I live to serve you.",7,4,9
1251,daario, m,daario, You've ordered us to be night watchmen.,7,4,7
1252,daario, m,daario," There is only one, and she does not want me.",7,4,10
1253,daario, m,daario, My sword is yours till the day I die.,7,4,9
1254,daario, m,daario, I'll stay in Meereen and patrol the streets. Send me to kill your enemies. Any enemy anywhere. Let me do what I do best.,7,4,24
1255,daario, m,daario, Jorah the Andal. Are you here to see our queen? She's in a good mood.,7,4,15
1256,daario, m,daario," That one, the smaller man, no question, that’s where you should put your money.",9,5,14
1257,daario, m,daario, People used to bet against me when I fought in the pits. (looks at Hizdahr) He would have bet against me. Common novice mistake.,9,5,24
1258,daario, m,daario," Whenever I got into the pit against a beast like that one, the crowd saw me, all skin and bone back then, then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me. They couldn’t get their money out fast enough. But the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here (he puts a dagger to his neck) or here (he puts the dagger to Hizdahr’s neck). And the big men were always too slow to stop my dagger from going where their muscles weren’t. Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one, standing across from me making his beast faces, I knew I could rest easy.",9,5,110
1259,daario, m,daario, Shut your mouth.,9,5,3
1260,daario, m,daario, Protect your queen!,9,5,3
1261,daario, m,daario," The other side, follow me!",9,5,5
1262,daario, m,daario, Protect your queen!,9,5,3
1263,daario, m,daario, Does he always talk so much?,10,5,6
1264,daario, m,daario," No, but he is.",10,5,4
1265,daario, m,daario, Our queen would be dead if not for him.,10,5,9
1266,daario, m,daario, You missed a good scrap.,10,5,5
1267,daario, m,daario," (gestures to Tyrion) He’s right. The Queen exiled Jorah. (gestures to Jorah) And he’s right, Jorah saved her life. Perhaps she feels differently about him now. Perhaps not. The only way we’ll know is if we ask her.",10,5,38
1268,daario, m,daario," Forgive me, but why would we bring you?",10,5,8
1269,daario, m,daario, Have you ever tracked animals in the wilderness?,10,5,8
1270,daario, m,daario, Can you fight?,10,5,3
1271,daario, m,daario, Are you good on a horse?,10,5,6
1272,daario, m,daario, So mainly you talk?,10,5,4
1273,daario, m,daario," Which I respect. But you would not help us on this expedition. You would help us here in Meereen, though. (to Missandei, Grey Worm, and Jorah) None of us have any experience governing a city, except for him. You want to prove your value to the queen? Prove it right here in Meereen.",10,5,53
1274,daario, m,daario, They wouldn’t. They will listen to Grey Worm.,10,5,8
1275,daario, m,daario," He is, he’s the toughest man with no balls I’ve ever met. But you still can’t go. The people believe in you. They know you speak for the queen.",10,5,29
1276,daario, m,daario," And Missandei. Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei. Certainly not me. The queen’s closest confidant, the commander of the Unsullied, and the foreign dwarf with the scarred face. Good fortune, my friends, Meereen is ancient and glorious. (to Tyrion) Try not to ruin her. (to Jorah) Looks like it’s you and me, Jorah the Andal. Let’s find some good horses. We have so much to talk about.",10,5,69
1277,daario, m,daario, The Unsullied are too conspicuous.,2,5,5
1278,daario, m,daario," Anyone can see you coming from a mile off. Of course you haven't found any Sons of the Harpy. You haven't, have you?",2,5,23
1279,daario, m,daario," My Second Sons, on the other hand, they drink, they whore, fight in the streets--they blend in. They overhear things in taverns, follow people from the taverns to nice, quiet alleys, break a few fingers, overhear a few more things. Before you know it...",2,5,44
1280,daario, m,daario, In a hurry? You're afraid?,2,5,5
1281,daario, m,daario," Right. That's your problem. You understood fear once, long ago, but you've forgotten what it means. Someone who's forgotten fear has forgotten how to hide.",2,5,25
1282,daario, m,daario, Fear is useful that way.,2,5,5
1283,daario, m,daario, The Son of the Harpy has no more valuable information.,2,5,10
1284,daario, m,daario, Because I questioned him.,2,5,4
1285,daario, m,daario, Which is what I keep telling her to do to you.,2,5,11
1286,daario, m,daario, When did the Unsullied start patrolling the streets of Meereen? Looks like your friends haven’t been behaving themselves.,1,5,18
1287,daario, m,daario, You should reopen the fighting pits.,1,5,6
1288,daario, m,daario," My mother was a whore, I told you that. She liked to drink pear brandy. The older she got, the less she made selling her body, the more she wanted to drink. So one day when I was 12, she sold me to a slaver she fucked the night before.",1,5,50
1289,daario, m,daario," I was a bad child. I wasn’t big, but I was quick. And I loved to fight. So they sold me to a man in Tolos who trained fighters for the pits. I had my first match when I was 16.",1,5,41
1290,daario, m,daario," I’m only here because of those pits. I learned to fight like a Dothraki screamer, a Norvoshi priest, a Westerosi knight. Soon I was famous. 10,000 men and women screamed my name when I stepped into the pit. I made so much money for my master he set me free when I died. I joined the Second Sons, and then I met you.",1,5,63
1291,daario, m,daario," You’re the queen. Everyone’s too afraid of you to speak truth. Everyone but me. You’ve made thousands of enemies all across the world. As soon as they see weakness, they’ll attack. Show your strength here, now.",1,5,36
1292,daario, m,daario, Anyone with a chest full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied. You’re not the Mother of Unsullied. You’re the Mother of Dragons.,1,5,24
1293,daario, m,daario, A dragon queen with no dragons is not a queen.,1,5,10
1294,daario, m,daario," We could pull back to the pyramid district, secure it, and use it as a base from which to operate. Then we clean the city out, neighborhood by neighborhood, street by street, until the rats have nowhere left to hide.",5,5,40
1295,daario, m,daario, How long before the king of Mereen comes to claim my pillow?,7,5,12
1296,daario, m,daario, I think the Sons of the Harpy have stopped killing because their leader was made king.,7,5,16
1297,daario, m,daario, Do you think I’m petty enough to speak ill of a man just because he represents competition?,7,5,17
1298,daario, m,daario, You’re right. My motivations are entirely impure.,7,5,7
1299,daario, m,daario, Doesn’t make me wrong.,7,5,4
1300,daario, m,daario, Everyone has a choice. Even slaves have a choice. Death or slavery.,7,5,12
1301,daario, m,daario, Marry me instead.,7,5,3
1302,daario, m,daario," Why not? You’re our queen, you can do as you like.",7,5,11
1303,daario, m,daario, Then you are the only person in Mereen who’s not free.,7,5,11
1304,daario, m,daario," I know I’m here to serve my queen and not to give advice, but can I make one more suggestion?",7,5,20
1305,daario, m,daario," On the day of the Great Games, gather all the great masters, and wise masters, and worthy masters you can find, and slaughter them all.",7,5,25
1306,daario, m,daario, All rulers are either butchers or meat.,7,5,7
1307,daario, m,daario, Your ships are nearly ready. I saw them painting the sails.,10,6,11
1308,daario, m,daario, I’m curious to see how the Dothraki do on the poison water.,10,6,12
1309,daario, m,daario," New strategy? You want the Second Sons to attack from the west coast? If we take Casterly Rock, the Lannisters will have nowhere to run when you hit King’s Landing.",10,6,30
1310,daario, m,daario," Fuck Meereen. Fuck the people. I’m here for you, not them.",10,6,11
1311,daario, m,daario, Who are you marrying this time?,10,6,6
1312,daario, m,daario, But you need to lure all the noble houses to the table? Are you a queen or fish bait?,10,6,19
1313,daario, m,daario, A king wouldn’t think twice about it.,10,6,7
1314,daario, m,daario, I’m not proud. I don’t care what perfumed aristocrat sits beside you in the throne room. I don’t want a crown. I want you.,10,6,24
1315,daario, m,daario, I love you. And I make you happy. You know I do. Bring me with you. Let me fight for you.,10,6,21
1316,daario, m,daario, The dwarf told you to do this.,10,6,7
1317,daario, m,daario, Clever fellow. Can’t argue with his logic. I’m no use to you over there.,10,6,14
1318,daario, m,daario," I’m not angry. I’m full of self-pity. Who comes after you? Who can ever follow Daenerys Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?",10,6,21
1319,daario, m,daario, Bay of Dragons?,10,6,3
1320,daario, m,daario," You’ll get that throne you want so badly, I’m sure of it. I hope it brings you happiness.",10,6,18
1321,daario, m,daario, I pity the lord of Westeros. They have no idea what’s coming for them.,10,6,14
1322,daario, m,daario, Goat?,1,6,1
1323,daario, m,daario, You think our friend got him?,1,6,6
1324,daario, m,daario," We’re on the right path, then.",1,6,6
1325,daario, m,daario, Perhaps she’s tired of being queen. I don’t think she likes it very much.,1,6,14
1326,daario, m,daario," Maybe she’s flown somewhere else, somewhere far away from men like us.",1,6,12
1327,daario, m,daario," There’s no escaping her, eh? You keep coming back. Why?",1,6,10
1328,daario, m,daario, isn’t it frustrating wanting someone who doesn’t want you back?,1,6,10
1329,daario, m,daario," You’re a romantic. I admire that. Sometimes I look at you and I think, “So that’s what I’ll be like when I grow old.”",1,6,24
1330,daario, m,daario, If I grow old. I hope I do. I want to see what the world looks like when she’s done conquering it.,1,6,22
1331,daario, m,daario," Huh, an army?",1,6,3
1332,daario, m,daario, Dothraki?,1,6,1
1333,daario, m,daario, You all right? Why don’t you sit and catch your breath?,4,6,11
1334,daario, m,daario," I don’t think you could ride the dragon. 20 years ago, maybe.",4,6,12
1335,daario, m,daario," Our queen. She’s wild, you know. Don’t let her size fool you. It’s hard enough for me and I’m a young man. You, I don’t think your heart could take it.",4,6,31
1336,daario, m,daario, Must make you angry that our queen chose me.,4,6,9
1337,daario, m,daario, We’ll all disappoint her before long.,4,6,6
1338,daario, m,daario," Oh, I don’t want to fight you, Jorah the Andal. What do I have to gain? If I win, I’m the shit who killed an old man. If I lose, I’m the shit who was killed by an old man.",4,6,40
1339,daario, m,daario, None.,4,6,1
1340,daario, m,daario, What are you doing?,4,6,4
1341,daario, m,daario, Isn’t it forbidden to sneak into their city and steal their khaleesi?,4,6,12
1342,daario, m,daario, You’re asking a dog to hand over his teeth.,4,6,9
1343,daario, m,daario, I’m very attached to this knife.,4,6,6

1493,joffrey, m,joffrey, Who?,2,3,1
1494,joffrey, m,joffrey," She's an ideal match. With the Tyrells beside us, we'll crush the Northerners. Hang their lords, burn their strongholds, sow their fields with salt, and no one will think of rebelling for another century.",2,3,34
1495,joffrey, m,joffrey," Yes, she is.",2,3,3
1496,joffrey, m,joffrey, Not to me.,2,3,3

1503,joffrey, m,joffrey, Good. Good. How are you finding life in the capital? It must be quite a change after Renly's camp.,2,3,19
1504,joffrey, m,joffrey, And the bedside of a traitor? Is that a place for a lady?,2,3,13
1505,joffrey, m,joffrey, What was your duty to this traitor as you saw it?,2,3,11
1506,joffrey, m,joffrey, You failed to do this.,2,3,5
1507,joffrey, m,joffrey, You think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor merely because he's had a sword put through his heart?,2,3,20

1511,joffrey, m,joffrey, Yes. I am.,2,3,3
1512,joffrey, m,joffrey, Do you like it? I just had it made. Probably one of the finest weapons in the Seven Kingdoms.,2,3,19
1513,joffrey, m,joffrey,  It's a new design. Much easier to load. There's no crank. You use this lever to draw the string.,2,3,19
1514,joffrey, m,joffrey, The bolt goes here.,2,3,4
1515,joffrey, m,joffrey, And then you just aim and,2,3,6
1516,joffrey, m,joffrey, It's not unheard of.,2,3,4
1517,joffrey, m,joffrey, Could you do it? Could you kill something?.,2,3,8

1519,joffrey, m,joffrey, Yes.,2,3,1
1520,joffrey, m,joffrey, Why have we stopped?,1,3,4
1521,joffrey, m,joffrey, No.,1,3,1
1522,joffrey, m,joffrey," Please, sit. Sit. I do apologize, my lady. Small council meetings. At what point does it become treason to waste the king's time?",1,3,23
1523,joffrey, m,joffrey," That's a lovely gown, my lady.",1,3,6
1524,joffrey, m,joffrey," Shall I have them bring you a shawl, my lady?",1,3,10
1525,joffrey, m,joffrey, My mother's always had a penchant for drama. Facts become less and less important to her as she grows older. Our lives were never truly in danger.,1,3,27
1526,joffrey, m,joffrey," Well, as Ser Loras said, Lady Margaery has done this sort of... charitable work before. I'm sure she knows what she's doing.",1,3,22
1527,joffrey, m,joffrey," Rhaenyra Targaryen was murdered by her brother, or rather his dragon. It ate her while her son watched. What's left of her is buried in the crypts right down there.",4,3,30
1528,joffrey, m,joffrey," Over there in that urn, the ashes of Aerion Targaryen. Aerion Brightflame they called him. He thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon.",4,3,25
1529,joffrey, m,joffrey," He was wrong. And, of course, there's the Mad King, killed by my uncle. Would you like to see where the last Targaryens are buried?",4,3,25
1530,joffrey, m,joffrey, The tomb's just up here.,4,3,5
1531,joffrey, m,joffrey," My father didn't want them here. He was going to have their bodies burned and thrown in the Blackwater, but the High Septon convinced him otherwise.",4,3,26
1532,joffrey, m,joffrey, I couldn't agree more.,4,3,4
1533,joffrey, m,joffrey, Open the doors.,4,3,3
1534,joffrey, m,joffrey, Grandfather.,7,3,1
1535,joffrey, m,joffrey,  Yes. I'd like a report on the meetings of my small council.,7,3,12
1536,joffrey, m,joffrey, I've been very busy. Many important matters require a king's attention.,7,3,11
1537,joffrey, m,joffrey, You've been holding the council meetings in the Tower of the Hand instead of the small council chamber.,7,3,18
1538,joffrey, m,joffrey, May I ask why?,7,3,4
1539,joffrey, m,joffrey," So if I wanted to attend a council meeting, I would now have to climb all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand?",7,3,24
1540,joffrey, m,joffrey, Tell me about the Targaryen girl in the east and her dragons.,7,3,12
1541,joffrey, m,joffrey, Is it true?,7,3,3
1542,joffrey, m,joffrey, Don't you think we ought to do something about it?,7,3,10
1543,joffrey, m,joffrey, And the biggest was the size of a carriage.,7,3,9
1544,joffrey, m,joffrey, But how do we know these dragons are just curiosities and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel?,7,3,21
1545,joffrey, m,joffrey, But I haven't been counseled.,7,3,5
1546,joffrey, m,joffrey, I should be consulted about such things.,7,3,7
1547,joffrey, m,joffrey," A handsome goblet, my lord. Or shall I call you Father?",2,4,11
1548,joffrey, m,joffrey, A book?,2,4,2
1549,joffrey, m,joffrey," Now that the war is won, we should all find time for wisdom. Thank you, Uncle.",2,4,16
1550,joffrey, m,joffrey, So they say.,2,4,3
1551,joffrey, m,joffrey, Such a great sword should have a name. What shall I call her?,2,4,13
1552,joffrey, m,joffrey," Widow's Wail. I like that. Every time I use it, it'll be like cutting off. Ned Stark's head all over again.",2,4,21
1553,joffrey, m,joffrey," With this kiss, I pledge my love.",2,4,7
1554,joffrey, m,joffrey, Very good. Very good. Off you go.,2,4,7
1555,joffrey, m,joffrey, Everyone. The queen would like to say a few words.,2,4,10
1556,joffrey, m,joffrey, You're the one who put a sword through Renly Baratheon.,2,4,10
1557,joffrey, m,joffrey, A shame. I'd knight the man that put an end to that deviant's life.,2,4,14
1558,joffrey, m,joffrey," Yes, yes.",2,4,2
1559,joffrey, m,joffrey, A gold dragon to whoever knocks my fool's hat off.,2,4,10
1560,joffrey, m,joffrey," Everyone, silence! Clear the floor. There's been too much amusement here today. A royal wedding is not an amusement. A royal wedding is history. The time has come for all of us to contemplate our history. My lords... my ladies...",2,4,40
1561,joffrey, m,joffrey," I give you. King Joffrey... Renly, Stannis, Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy. The War of the Five Kings.",2,4,17

1569,joffrey, m,joffrey, Fine gentlemen.,2,4,2
1570,joffrey, m,joffrey," Well fought. Well fought. Here you are. Champion's purse. Though you're not the champion yet, are you? A true champion defeats all the challengers. Surely there are others out there who still dare to challenge my reign. Uncle How about you? I'm sure they have a spare costume.",2,4,48
1571,joffrey, m,joffrey, It did not spill.,2,4,4
1572,joffrey, m,joffrey," Well, how does he expect me to toast without wine? Uncle, you can be my cupbearer seeing as you're too cowardly to fight.",2,4,23
1573,joffrey, m,joffrey, It's not meant as an honor.,2,4,6
1574,joffrey, m,joffrey,  Bring me my goblet.,2,4,4
1575,joffrey, m,joffrey, What good is an empty cup? Fill it.,2,4,8
1576,joffrey, m,joffrey, Kneel. Kneel before your king.,2,4,5
1577,joffrey, m,joffrey, Kneel. I said... kneel!,2,4,4
1578,joffrey, m,joffrey, My queen.,2,4,2
1579,joffrey, m,joffrey," Uncle. Where are you going? You're my cupbearer, remember?",2,4,9
1580,joffrey, m,joffrey," No, no, no. No, you're perfect the way you are. Serve me my wine.",2,4,14
1581,joffrey, m,joffrey," Well, hurry up. This pie is dry.",2,4,7

1597,joffrey, m,joffrey, You'll kiss it again when I return and taste my uncle's blood.,9,2,12
1598,joffrey, m,joffrey, If Stannis is fool enough to come near me.,9,2,9
1599,joffrey, m,joffrey, A king doesn't discuss battle plans with stupid girls.,9,2,9

1601,joffrey, m,joffrey, Why isn't it here now? They're coming.,9,2,7

1622,joffrey, m,joffrey," I, too, have heard tales of your beauty and grace, but the tales do not do you justice, my lady. It would be an honor to return your love, but I am promised to another. A king must keep his word.",10,2,41

1635,joffrey, m,joffrey, What did you say? Did you say I can't?,1,2,9
1636,joffrey, m,joffrey, What kind of stupid peasant's superstition...,1,2,6
1637,joffrey, m,joffrey," (Sighs). Take him away. I'll have him killed tomorrow, the fool.",1,2,11
1638,joffrey, m,joffrey," Did you hear My Lady, Ser Dontos? (Ser Dontos is forced onto his feet). From this day, (Standing up), you'll be my new fool.",1,2,24

1640,joffrey, m,joffrey, We heard you were dead.,1,2,5
1641,joffrey, m,joffrey, Her loss? Her father was a confessed traitor!,1,2,8
1642,joffrey, m,joffrey, What work? (Bronn and the tribesmen follow Tyrion. Joffrey stands up). Why are you here?,1,2,15
1643,joffrey, m,joffrey," Returning this room to its proper appearance. Say what you will about the Targaryens, they were conquerors. That is a seat for a conqueror. It needs a room to match it, not vines and flowers.",1,2,35
1644,joffrey, m,joffrey," With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere.",1,2,8
1645,joffrey, m,joffrey, I think they might. They're weak. They put too much value on their women. (Walks towards the throne).,1,2,18
1646,joffrey, m,joffrey, The King does not ask; He commands. And my grandfather's stupidity in the field of battle is the reason Robb Stark has Uncle Jaime in the first place.,1,2,28
1647,joffrey, m,joffrey, We're at war. All our lives are in danger. I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime. And you.,1,2,19
1648,joffrey, m,joffrey, It's not a claim. The throne is mine.,1,2,8
1649,joffrey, m,joffrey, Someone believes it. Father had other children? Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?,1,2,13
1650,joffrey, m,joffrey, I'm asking if he fucked other women when he grew tired of you. How many bastards does he have running -,1,2,21

1659,joffrey, m,joffrey, I'm punishing her.,4,2,3
1660,joffrey, m,joffrey, You can't talk to me like that. The king can do as he likes!,4,2,14
1661,joffrey, m,joffrey," What are you doing here, dog?",4,2,6
1662,joffrey, m,joffrey, And? What is it?,4,2,4

1668,joffrey, m,joffrey, Harder.,4,2,1
1669,joffrey, m,joffrey, I said harder. He'd want me to get his money's worth.,4,2,11
1670,joffrey, m,joffrey," Oh, I want him to find out. You will bring her to his chambers when you're finished and show him what you've done, or the same thing will happen to you.",4,2,31
1671,joffrey, m,joffrey, Begin.,4,2,1
1672,joffrey, m,joffrey, Harder!,4,2,1
1673,joffrey, m,joffrey, You sound like a little cat mewling for his mother. Princes don't cry.,6,2,13

1677,joffrey, m,joffrey," Not really relevant then, is it? Come, dog.",6,2,8
1678,joffrey, m,joffrey, Who threw that? I want the man who threw that. Find who did that and bring him to me!,6,2,19
1679,joffrey, m,joffrey, Just kill them! Kill them all!,6,2,6
1680,joffrey, m,joffrey, What are you doing? I want these people executed!,6,2,9
1681,joffrey, m,joffrey, You can't insult me.,6,2,4
1682,joffrey, m,joffrey, You can't,6,2,2
1683,joffrey, m,joffrey, They attacked me!,6,2,3
1684,joffrey, m,joffrey, You're talking to a king!,6,2,5
1685,joffrey, m,joffrey, Let them have her.,6,2,4
1686,joffrey, m,joffrey,"  My mother wishes me to let Lord Eddard join The Night's Watch. Stripped of all titles and powers, he would serve the realm in permanent exile.

1708,joffrey, m,joffrey,  I don't want to.,3,1,4

1710,joffrey, m,joffrey,"  I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army.",3,1,15
1711,joffrey, m,joffrey,"  Why should every lord command his own men? It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers... Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives.",3,1,45
1712,joffrey, m,joffrey," I'd crush them. Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe.",3,1,20

1731,joffrey, m,joffrey,  Yes it is! They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river.,2,1,15
1732,joffrey, m,joffrey,  Shut up!,2,1,2
1733,joffrey, m,joffrey,  My lady. I fear I have behaved monstrously the past few weeks. With your permission?,6,1,15

The tradition is a brutish one, a scheme devised by corrupt rulers in order to avoid true judgment from the gods. Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell will stand trial before seven septons as it was in the earliest days of the Faith. Seven blessings to all.",8,6,71
2034,tommen, m,tommen, All right. I’m ready.,10,6,4
2035,tommen, m,tommen, My mother would like to see her daughter’s final resting place.,3,6,11
2036,tommen, m,tommen, When will it be possible?,3,6,5
2037,tommen, m,tommen, You’ve cut off her hair and marched her naked through the streets in front of the whole city. That wasn’t a full atonement?,3,6,23
2038,tommen, m,tommen, I want you to let her see Myrcella’s resting place.,3,6,10
2039,tommen, m,tommen, I am the king.,3,6,4
2040,tommen, m,tommen, And what does that mean to you?,3,6,7
2041,tommen, m,tommen, My mother who is unclean? My mother who still needs to atone after all you’ve put her through?,3,6,18
2042,tommen, m,tommen, Yes.,3,6,1
2043,tommen, m,tommen, Of course.,3,6,2
2044,tommen, m,tommen, I still don’t understand why you want to put her through any more than she's already endured.,3,6,17
2045,tommen, m,tommen, My grandfather once said something similar. Except for the part about the gods.,3,6,13
2046,tommen, m,tommen, She grew up.,2,6,3
2047,tommen, m,tommen, Have we caught Prince Trystane’s killers? I expect it was Mother.,2,6,11
2048,tommen, m,tommen," Yes, she would.",2,6,3
2049,tommen, m,tommen, Of course not.,2,6,3
2050,tommen, m,tommen, They told me she wouldn’t be allowed in the sept. If she had tried --,2,6,15
2051,tommen, m,tommen, Don’t you think I know that? I’m sorry. But I can’t.,2,6,11
2052,tommen, m,tommen," When the Faith Militant seized her and Margaery, what did I do? When they paraded her through the streets like a whore, what did I do?",2,6,26
2053,tommen, m,tommen," The king is supposed to be the Protector of the Realm. If I can’t even protect my own wife or my own mother, what good am I?",2,6,27
2054,tommen, m,tommen, I want to see my wife.,2,6,6
2055,tommen, m,tommen, Mother.,2,6,1
2056,tommen, m,tommen, Gold.,2,6,1
2057,tommen, m,tommen, I know I should have come sooner. I wanted to. I was wrong.,2,6,13
2058,tommen, m,tommen," No, it isn’t.",2,6,3
2059,tommen, m,tommen," I should have executed all of them. I should have pulled down the sept onto the High Sparrow’s head before I let them do that to you, as you would have for me. You raised me to be strong...and I wasn’t. But I want to be. Help me.",2,6,48
2060,tommen, m,tommen," Thank you for your counsel, Grand Maester. That will be all for now.",4,6,13
2061,tommen, m,tommen, I’ve been thinking about the High Sparrow.,4,6,7
2062,tommen, m,tommen, We need to be careful in dealing with such a man. To prevent things from escalating any further. We have to be careful not to antagonize him. He has Margaery. We can’t put her at risk. He’s dangerous.,4,6,38
2063,tommen, m,tommen," You don’t like Margaery, do you?",4,6,6
2064,tommen, m,tommen, Mother...there’s something I want to tell you. Something the High Sparrow told me.,4,6,13
2065,tommen, m,tommen, I promised him I wouldn’t tell anyone. If he found out I told --,4,6,14
2066,tommen, m,tommen, Is there no other way?,6,6,5
2067,tommen, m,tommen, Of course I’m afraid for her! It just seems very dangerous.,6,6,11
2068,tommen, m,tommen, She’s always been very devoted to the poor and the unfortunate.,6,6,11
2069,tommen, m,tommen, Have they hurt you? Have they mistreated you?,6,6,8
2070,tommen, m,tommen, I’ve missed you. More than you could know.,6,6,8
2071,tommen, m,tommen," Yes, a few times. Have you?",6,6,6
2072,tommen, m,tommen, What are you talking about? You’re a good person. You’ve always been a good person. You’re the best person I know.,6,6,21
2073,tommen, m,tommen, I was just telling him about your devotion to the poor.,6,6,11
2074,tommen, m,tommen, I don’t understand.,6,6,3
2075,tommen, m,tommen, What about Loras?,6,6,3
2076,tommen, m,tommen, The crown and the faith are the twin pillars upon which the world rests. Together we will restore the Seven Kingdoms to glory.,6,6,23
2077,tommen, m,tommen," When you attack the Faith, you attack the Crown. Anyone who attacks the Crown is unfit to serve as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.",6,6,24
2078,tommen, m,tommen, I have to answer to the gods.,6,6,7
2079,tommen, m,tommen, The Crown’s decision on this matter is final.,6,6,8
2080,tommen, m,tommen, You have served your house and your king faithfully for many years. And you will continue to do so. But not in this city.,6,6,24
2081,gendry, m,gendry,  I've never seen anything like any of this. Not in my life.,8,3,12
2082,gendry, m,gendry, In Flea Bottom we called them bowls of brown. We'd pretend that the meat in them was chicken. We knew it wasn't chicken.,8,3,23
2083,gendry, m,gendry,  That's good.,8,3,2
2084,gendry, m,gendry, That's really good.,8,3,3
2085,gendry, m,gendry,  I couldn't even guess.,8,3,4
2086,gendry, m,gendry," That thought had crossed my mind, yeah.",8,3,7
2087,gendry, m,gendry, I'm a mistake. I'm only here because my father grabbed my mother instead of the girl next to her in the tavern.,8,3,22
2088,gendry, m,gendry, What are you doing?,8,3,4
2089,gendry, m,gendry, What--?  Get it away. Get it off me.,8,3,8
2090,gendry, m,gendry, Why are you doing this?,8,3,5
2091,gendry, m,gendry," No. No, no, no, no! Not there. Not there!",8,3,9
2092,gendry, m,gendry," Please. Please, Your Grace. My lord!",8,3,6
2093,gendry, m,gendry, (cries out),8,3,2
2094,gendry, m,gendry, Great. Never better.,10,3,3
2095,gendry, m,gendry," I should have known. Every time a highborn asks my name, it's trouble. We're not really people to you, are we? Just a million different ways to get what you want.",10,3,31
2096,gendry, m,gendry, She called you Ser. I heard it.,10,3,7
2097,gendry, m,gendry," Sure, you were. You're my friend. You're here to help.",10,3,10
2098,gendry, m,gendry, How far below? How close to the Red Keep were you?,10,3,11
2099,gendry, m,gendry, Gin Alley.,10,3,2
2100,gendry, m,gendry," Yeah, we've come a long way. We're all the same, really. She went to great pains to point that out to me.",10,3,22
2101,gendry, m,gendry, So how'd you become a lord?,10,3,6
2102,gendry, m,gendry," Better not, then. I'm a bit busy.",10,3,7
2103,gendry, m,gendry, You see? Highborns.,10,3,3
2104,gendry, m,gendry, Why did you?,10,3,3
2105,gendry, m,gendry, Does he?,10,3,2
2106,gendry, m,gendry, How'd he die?,10,3,3
2107,gendry, m,gendry, What are you doing?,10,3,4
2108,gendry, m,gendry, Is this some kind of trick?,10,3,6
2109,gendry, m,gendry, I know not to drink seawater.,10,3,6
2110,gendry, m,gendry, Where should I go?,10,3,4
2111,gendry, m,gendry, The gold cloaks are looking for me.,10,3,7
2112,gendry, m,gendry, No.,10,3,1
2113,gendry, m,gendry, No.,10,3,1
2114,gendry, m,gendry, You know how to swim?,10,3,5
2115,gendry, m,gendry, No.,10,3,1
2116,gendry, m,gendry, Why are you doing this?,10,3,5
2117,gendry, m,gendry," If I had a proper forge, I could make it good as new.",3,3,13
2118,gendry, m,gendry, You're what?,3,3,2
2119,gendry, m,gendry," Yes, it is.",3,3,3
2120,gendry, m,gendry," Well, be safe.",3,3,3
2121,gendry, m,gendry, You don't burn your fingers.,3,3,5
2122,gendry, m,gendry, I'm just trying to understand.,2,3,5
2123,gendry, m,gendry, Jaqen H'ghar offered you three kills.,2,3,6
2124,gendry, m,gendry, But just explain it to me. He offered to kill any three people you wanted. Dead. All you had to do was give him the names. Anyone. You could have picked King Joffrey.,2,3,33
2125,gendry, m,gendry, You could have picked Tywin Lannister.,2,3,6
2126,gendry, m,gendry, But you could have ended the war.,2,3,7
2127,gendry, m,gendry, North.,2,3,1
2128,gendry, m,gendry, Maybe we already passed it.,2,3,5
2129,gendry, m,gendry, Could be a minstrel.,2,3,4
2130,gendry, m,gendry, King's Landing. Tobho Mott's shop.,2,3,5
2131,gendry, m,gendry, That's because he's twice as good.,2,3,6
2132,gendry, m,gendry," Arya, don't!",5,3,2
2133,gendry, m,gendry, Just mending Lord Beric's armor.,5,3,5
2134,gendry, m,gendry, I'm going to stay on and smith for the Brotherhood.,5,3,10
2135,gendry, m,gendry, The Lannisters wanted to kill me long before I joined the Brotherhood.,5,3,12
2136,gendry, m,gendry, I want to. They need good men.,5,3,7
2137,gendry, m,gendry," What? Serve him? I've served men my entire life. I served Master Mott at King's Landing and he sold me to the Watch. I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal, wondering every day if I'd get tortured or killed. I'm done serving.",5,3,41
2138,gendry, m,gendry," He may be their leader, but they chose him. These men are brothers. They're a family. I've never had a family.",5,3,21
2139,gendry, m,gendry, You wouldn't be my family. You'd be 'my lady.,5,3,9
2140,gendry, m,gendry, I'd have some.,4,3,3
2141,gendry, m,gendry, What is this place?,4,3,4
2142,gendry, m,gendry," Yeah, nothing tricky about it. Just need decent steel.",6,3,9
2143,gendry, m,gendry, (laughs),6,3,1
2144,gendry, m,gendry, You told me this was a Brotherhood. You told me I could be one of you.,6,3,16
2145,gendry, m,gendry, What happened?,7,3,2
2146,gendry, m,gendry," After all the running and fighting, here I am, back where I started.",7,3,13
2147,gendry, m,gendry, King's Landing?,7,3,2
2148,gendry, m,gendry, Never had a father. Never wanted one.,7,3,7
2149,gendry, m,gendry,  I'm lowborn. As low as can be. My mother was a tavern wench.,7,3,13
2150,gendry, m,gendry, I was born in Flea Bottom.,7,3,6
2151,gendry, m,gendry," Are you saying my father, he was some lord or",7,3,10
2152,gendry, m,gendry, I'm just a bastard.,7,3,4
2153,gendry, m,gendry, You need him?,8,2,3
2154,gendry, m,gendry, Shut up.,8,2,2
2155,gendry, m,gendry, What about the guards?,8,2,4
2156,gendry, m,gendry," What, he left that bit out? It's a pretty important part, don't you think?",8,2,14
2157,gendry, m,gendry, Trust him? You trusted him to fight with us when you set him free and he ran.,8,2,17
2158,gendry, m,gendry," Arry, don't.",8,2,2
2159,gendry, m,gendry, Get up.,3,2,2
2160,gendry, m,gendry, I can fight.,3,2,3
2161,gendry, m,gendry, Yoren said none of us were should go near of those three.,2,2,12
2162,gendry, m,gendry, Hmm? Then you're stupid. They scare me.,2,2,7
2163,gendry, m,gendry, What are you doing?,2,2,4
2164,gendry, m,gendry, Now who told you that.,2,2,5
2165,gendry, m,gendry, How'd you know he was a knight?,2,2,7
2166,gendry, m,gendry, You don't have to be a knight to have armor. Any idiot can buy armor. (Arya smiles).,2,2,17
2167,gendry, m,gendry, ‘Cause I sold armor.,2,2,4
2168,gendry, m,gendry, (Turning around) No idea.,2,2,4
2169,gendry, m,gendry, (Walking to camp fire). You shouldn't insult people that are bigger than you.,2,2,13
2170,gendry, m,gendry,"  Well, I don’t care what any of them want. No good's ever come of their questions.",2,2,16
2171,gendry, m,gendry, How can someone so small be such a huge pain in my ass?,2,2,13
2172,gendry, m,gendry," The Hand of the King. Er, hands of the King. Lord Arryn came first, a few weeks before he died. And then Lord Stark came, a few weeks before he died.",2,2,31
2173,gendry, m,gendry, See? Asking me questions is bad luck. (Walks back to river). You'll probably be dead soon.,2,2,16
2174,gendry, m,gendry, My mom.,2,2,2
2175,gendry, m,gendry, Just my mom. Worked in a tavern. Died when I was little.,2,2,12
2176,gendry, m,gendry," He could be one of those gold-hatted bastards, for all I know. What about you, anyway? You thought they were after you, why? Did you kill someone, or is it just because you're a girl?",2,2,35
2177,gendry, m,gendry, (Walks back to camp fire). Yes you are. You think I'm as stupid as the rest of them?,2,2,18
2178,gendry, m,gendry, That's true. You're still a girl.,2,2,6
2179,gendry, m,gendry," Well, pull your cock out and take a piss then.",2,2,10
2180,gendry, m,gendry, They won't. Not from me.,2,2,5
2181,gendry, m,gendry, He was your father. The Hand. The traitor.,2,2,8
2182,gendry, m,gendry," So you're a highborn, then. You're a lady.",2,2,8
2183,gendry, m,gendry," You were a lord's daughter and you lived in a castle. Look, all that about cocks. I should never have said that. I've been pissing in front of you and everything. I should be calling you milady.",2,2,37
2184,gendry, m,gendry," As milady commands. (Arya pushes him). Well, that was unladylike.",2,2,10
2185,gendry, m,gendry, Sideface?,5,2,1
2186,gendry, m,gendry, Why?,5,2,1
2187,gendry, m,gendry, Am I fighting someone?,5,2,4
2188,gendry, m,gendry," No, all the dragons are dead.",4,2,6
2189,gendry, m,gendry, They take someone every day?,4,2,5
2190,gendry, m,gendry, I'm not from the village.,4,2,5
2191,gendry, m,gendry, I don't know what that is.,4,2,6
2192,gendry, m,gendry," Smith, my lord.",4,2,3
2193,gendry, m,gendry,  Weren't you worried about the Goldcloaks?,5,7,6
2194,gendry, m,gendry,  Here I am arming Lannisters.  I never get a second look.  You were right.  Safest place for me was right under the queen's nose.,5,7,24
2195,gendry, m,gendry,  You came to get me.  You want me to come with you.,5,7,12
2196,gendry, m,gendry,  I'm ready.  Let's go.,5,7,4
2197,gendry, m,gendry,  Don't you think I've been thinking about it every swing of the hammer... how happy I am making weapons for the family that killed my father?  They tried to kill me.,5,7,31
2198,gendry, m,gendry,"  I've been getting ready.  I never knew what for, but I've always known I'd know it when it comes.",5,7,19
2199,gendry, m,gendry,"  I don't know much about swinging swords, but this --",5,7,10
2200,gendry, m,gendry,  Who should I say I am?,5,7,6
2201,gendry, m,gendry,  That they are.  I try to stay away from them to avoid good men such as yourselves.,5,7,17
2202,gendry, m,gendry,  I understand.,5,7,2
2203,gendry, m,gendry,  You don't have to worry.,5,7,5
2204,gendry, m,gendry,  Understood.,5,7,1
2205,gendry, m,gendry,"  It's Gendry, Your Grace.  I'm Robert Baratheon's son.  Bastard son.",5,7,10
2206,gendry, m,gendry,  Our fathers trusted each other.  Why shouldn't we?,5,7,8
2207,gendry, m,gendry,  I met yours in my shop.,5,7,6
2208,gendry, m,gendry,  You're a lot shorter.,5,7,4
2209,gendry, m,gendry,"  All I ever knew was they fought together and won.  Ser Davos told me where you're going, Your Grace, and why.  Let me come with you.",5,7,26
2210,gendry, m,gendry,"  No, but I'm a fighter.  And he won't be needing a smith with a sword like that.",5,7,17
2211,gendry, m,gendry,  I prefer a hammer.,5,7,4
2212,gendry, m,gendry,"  I owe you my life.  Twice over.  But if what you said is true about what's out there, I can't wait out this war.",5,7,24
2213,gendry, m,gendry,  Don't trust them.  Don't trust any of them.,5,7,8
2214,gendry, m,gendry,  They're the Brotherhood.  And the last thing their Lord told them to do was sell me to a Red Witch to be murdered.,5,7,23
2215,gendry, m,gendry,  How can we be?,5,7,4
2216,gendry, m,gendry,  Never seen snow before.,6,7,4
2217,gendry, m,gendry,  How do you live up here?  How do you keep your balls from freezing off?,6,7,15
2218,gendry, m,gendry,  You sold me to a witch.,6,7,6
2219,gendry, m,gendry,"  I wanted to be one of you.  I wanted to join the Brotherhood but you sold me off like a slave.  Do you know what she did to me?  She strapped me down on a bed, she stripped me naked --",6,7,41
2220,gendry, m,gendry,  Yes. Thank you.  I know that.,6,7,6
2221,gendry, m,gendry,  She wanted to kill me.  They would have killed me if it wasn't for Davos --,6,7,16
2222,gendry, m,gendry,  I'm not whinging.,6,7,3
2223,gendry, m,gendry, Don't you have something better to do?,2,8,7
2224,gendry, m,gendry, Just as soon as I'm done making a few thousand of these.,2,8,12
2225,gendry, m,gendry, It's strong enough.,2,8,3
2226,gendry, m,gendry," It's going to be safer down in the crypt, you know.",2,8,11
2227,gendry, m,gendry," No, but-",2,8,2
2228,gendry, m,gendry, I've done my share.,2,8,4
2229,gendry, m,gendry, I did. Some of them.,2,8,5
2230,gendry, m,gendry, A few. That was enough.,2,8,5
2231,gendry, m,gendry, Bad. Really bad.,2,8,3
2232,gendry, m,gendry," Look, I know you want to fight. And I know you're not scared of rapers or murderers or-This is different. This is-This is death. You want to know what they're like? Death. That's what they're like.",2,8,36
2233,gendry, m,gendry, I'll get right on it.,2,8,5
2234,gendry, m,gendry," Last time you saw me, you wanted me to come to Winterfell. Took the long road, but…",2,8,17
2235,gendry, m,gendry, She wanted my blood for some kind of spell.,2,8,9
2236,gendry, m,gendry," I'm Robert Baratheon's bastard. I didn't know until she told me. Then she tied me up, stripped me down, put leeches all over me.",2,8,24
2237,gendry, m,gendry," No, yeah, I've never had leeches put all over my cock.",2,8,11
2238,gendry, m,gendry, What? I-I didn't-I wasn't with her.,2,8,6
2239,gendry, m,gendry," Yes, I was.",2,8,3
2240,gendry, m,gendry," Well, I didn't keep count.",2,8,5
2241,gendry, m,gendry, Three.,2,8,1
2242,gendry, m,gendry," Arya, I-",2,8,2
2243,gendry, m,gendry," Hey, careful, lads. We need every last bit of it.",1,8,10
2244,gendry, m,gendry, Are these the last of the wagons?,1,8,7
2245,gendry, m,gendry," All right, let's get it all to the forges.",1,8,9
2246,gendry, m,gendry, It isn't easy making a blade that big with dragonglass.,1,8,10
2247,gendry, m,gendry, I'm just saying it's a tricky material to-,1,8,8
2248,gendry, m,gendry," Yeah, thanks. So have you.",1,8,5
2249,gendry, m,gendry," I mean, you look good.",1,8,5
2250,gendry, m,gendry," It's not a bad place to grow up, if it wasn't so cold.",1,8,13
2251,gendry, m,gendry," Is that a command, Lady Stark?",1,8,6
2252,gendry, m,gendry," As you wish, milady.",1,8,4
2253,gendry, m,gendry, What do you need something like this for?,1,8,8
2254,gendry, m,gendry, You already have a sword. What's that?,1,8,7
2255,gendry, m,gendry, It's Valyrian steel. I always knew you were just another rich girl.,1,8,12
2256,gendry, m,gendry, Have you seen Arya?,4,8,4
2257,gendry, m,gendry, I just want to thank her for--,4,8,7
2258,gendry, m,gendry," Look, it's not about that.",4,8,5
2259,gendry, m,gendry," Yes, Your Grace.",4,8,3
2260,gendry, m,gendry, (nods),4,8,1

2447,theon, m,theon," And what's your counsel, trusted friend?",10,2,6
2448,theon, m,theon," There's nowhere to run. I'd never make it back to the Iron Islands. And even if I did, even if by some miracle I slipped through the lines and made it home, I'd be a coward. The Greyjoy who ran. The shame of the family.",10,2,45
2449,theon, m,theon, I won't make it to the Wall. I won't make it 10 feet past the Winterfell gates.,10,2,17

2471,theon, m,theon," I'm not protecting anyone. I just wonder if it's not wiser to wait. Why risk going against the North if they would be our allies? Rise up against them and they could destroy us. But if we pledge fealty to them, they'll give us Casterly Rock.",3,2,46
2472,theon, m,theon, We do not sow.,3,2,4

2494,theon, m,theon, Have my things sent up to the castle.,2,2,8
2495,theon, m,theon," You should give me the reins, I'm a better rider than you. I've been on horseback for the last nine years.",2,2,21
2496,theon, m,theon, Don't you worry about my hands. (Theon begins fondling her). The sea's in my blood.,2,2,15

2507,theon, m,theon," I've lived with him, hunted with him, fought at his side, he thinks of me as a brother.",2,2,18
2508,theon, m,theon, I forget nothing. I remember my brothers. And I remember when my father was a king.,2,2,16
2509,theon, m,theon, I will lead the attack myself.,2,2,6
2510,theon, m,theon, I'm your son. Your only living heir. Who else?,2,2,9
2511,theon, m,theon, I told you to wait outside. (The person who entered is revealed to be Yara). How did you get past the guards?,2,2,22
2512,theon, m,theon, Yara?,2,2,1
2513,theon, m,theon, She can't lead an attack!,2,2,5
2514,theon, m,theon, You're a woman!,2,2,3
2515,theon, m,theon, You won't stand a chance against the Lannisters on your own.,2,2,11
2516,theon, m,theon," A word, Your Grace?",1,2,4
2517,theon, m,theon, It's not so bad once you get used to it.,1,2,10
2518,theon, m,theon," The Lannisters are going to reject your terms, you know?",1,2,10
2519,theon, m,theon," We can fight them in the fields as long as you like, but we won't beat them until you take King's Landing. And we can't take King's Landing without ships. My father has ships and men who know how to sail them.",1,2,42
2520,theon, m,theon," Men who fought King Robert to free themselves from the yoke of the South, just like you're doing now. I'm his only living son. He'll listen to me. I know he will.

2526,theon, m,theon, Thank you. Kind of you to come see me off.,5,2,10
2527,theon, m,theon, You'd better get out there. Wouldn't want her to set sail without you.,5,2,13
2528,theon, m,theon, Who are you?,5,2,3
2529,theon, m,theon, Why aren't you with the rest of them? Or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea? That would be good for a laugh.,5,2,31
2530,theon, m,theon, And how am I supposed to prove myself by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?,5,2,13
2531,theon, m,theon, And yet that's the task my father has given me to prove that I'm a true Iron Islander.,5,2,18
2532,theon, m,theon, The Stony Shore's not far from Torrhen's Square.,5,2,8
2533,theon, m,theon,"  No, we could. We could never hold it for more than a few days. As soon as Winterfell got word that we'd taken Torrhen's Square, the Starks would send their men to take it back. And then",5,2,37
2534,theon, m,theon, Take me to my ship.,5,2,5
2535,theon, m,theon, I've taken your castle.,6,2,4
2536,theon, m,theon, It's Prince Theon now. Get up. You have to get dressed. I've taken Winterfell. I took it. I'm occupying it. I sent men over the walls with grappling claws and ropes.,6,2,31
2537,theon, m,theon, To take the castle.,6,2,4
2538,theon, m,theon, And he sent me back to Pyke. I'm a Greyjoy. I can't fight for Robb and my father both. Where's Hodor?,6,2,21
2539,theon, m,theon, Find the halfwit.,6,2,3
2540,theon, m,theon, My men are bringing your people together in the courtyard.,6,2,10
2541,theon, m,theon," Yes, you will.",6,2,3
2542,theon, m,theon,"  The castle is mine. But these people are still yours. You'll yield to keep them safe, to keep them alive. That's what a good lord would do. Think carefully about what you want to say.",6,2,35
2543,theon, m,theon, Louder. Say Prince Theon.,6,2,4
2544,theon, m,theon," Listen to your little lord, Farlen. He has more sense than you do.",6,2,13
2545,theon, m,theon," If you serve me as loyally as you served Ned Stark, I will be as good to you as he ever was. Betray me, and you will wish you hadn't. Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke informing my father of my victory here. And one to Deepwood Motte to my sister. Inform her that she's to bring You are a maester of the Citadel, sworn to serve the Lord of Winterfell, are you not?",6,2,75
2546,theon, m,theon, I am the Lord of Winterfell as Bran just informed you. Send the ravens.,6,2,14
2547,theon, m,theon, I see you've finally learned how to address your betters. What do you want? I was brought here a captive.,6,2,20
2548,theon, m,theon, I'm the one who took you. What of it?,6,2,9
2549,theon, m,theon," Serve me how? I need fighters, not kitchen sluts.",6,2,9
2550,theon, m,theon, So you can bury it in my neck? Do you take me for a fool? Get up.,6,2,17
2551,theon, m,theon, You'll all go about your tasks as usual. And in a few days' time,6,2,14
2552,theon, m,theon," Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that we meet as foes.",6,2,10
2553,theon, m,theon, They are not my people.,6,2,5
2554,theon, m,theon," My brothers are dead. They died fighting Stark men, men like you.",6,2,12
2555,theon, m,theon," Among them, but not one of them. I was his hostage, taken from my home.",6,2,15
2556,theon, m,theon, He's not. He's dead. The Seven Kingdoms are at war. And Winterfell is mine.,6,2,14
2557,theon, m,theon," You've served this house faithfully, old man. But keep talking and I'll",6,2,12
2558,theon, m,theon,  Take him to the cells. Lock him up,6,2,8
2559,theon, m,theon,  I'll lock him in a cell until he rots.,6,2,9
2560,theon, m,theon," Ser Rodrik, I sentence you to death!",6,2,7
2561,theon, m,theon, The old man couldn't keep his mouth shut.,6,2,8
2562,theon, m,theon," He disrespected me in front of my men. That was his decision, not mine.",6,2,14
2563,theon, m,theon,  You'll address me as Prince Theon or you'll be next.,6,2,10
2564,theon, m,theon," You don't give commands anymore, little lord.",6,2,7
2565,theon, m,theon," Any last words, old man?",6,2,5
2566,theon, m,theon, Why on earth would I trust the word of a lying little savage like you?,6,2,15
2567,theon, m,theon, All wildlings are liars and savages with no loyalty to anything or anyone.,6,2,13
2568,theon, m,theon, How? And don't tell me to put a spear in your hand.,6,2,12
2569,theon, m,theon," I'm a prince now, and you'd do well",6,2,8
2570,theon, m,theon, Like what?,6,2,2
2571,theon, m,theon, You know things? Like what? How to eat dirt?,6,2,9
2572,theon, m,theon, Wait outside.,6,2,2
2573,theon, m,theon, I always wondered what you had under there.,6,2,8
2574,theon, m,theon, I'm not killing you. That's your price.,6,2,7

2576,theon, m,theon," Well, you shall have it, then. But only if you serve me well.",6,2,13
2577,theon, m,theon," A cripple? You let a cripple escape? The boy can't walk, but somehow he slipped past you?",7,2,17
2578,theon, m,theon," The giant? Hodor? Oh, that's all right, then. You let a halfwit escape with a cripple. And Rickon, too? The little one?",7,2,22
2579,theon, m,theon, Right. Get the horses and the hounds.,7,2,7
2580,theon, m,theon, Enjoying your first hunt?,7,2,4

2587,theon, m,theon," I'm looking at spending the rest of my life being treated like a fool and a eunuch by my own people. Ask yourself, is there anything I wouldn't do to stop that from happening? The hounds will find the scent again. I'll beat them until they do. I'll whip every man here until I have both those boys in hand. And once I've got them, the pampered little shits It's better to be cruel than weak.",7,2,76
2588,theon, m,theon, Where are they?,7,2,3

2592,theon, m,theon, Go back to Winterfell. Take him back.,7,2,7
2593,theon, m,theon, I told you what would happen. All of you. I told you what would happen if you served me loyally. And what would happen if you did not.,7,2,28

2609,theon, m,theon, I always wanted to do the right thing. Be the right kind of person. But I never knew what that meant. It always seemed like there's like there was an impossible choice I had to make. Stark or Greyjoy.,7,7,39

2760,jorah, m,jorah, Very good.  We'll prepare.,9,3,4

2763,jorah, m,jorah, [Addressing DAARIO] That’s what you call a few guards?,9,3,9
2764,jorah, m,jorah, [Looks at DAENERYS]  It was just as you said.  They did not believe until it was too late.  Their slave soldiers threw down their spears and surrendered.,9,3,27
2765,jorah, m,jorah, They can be trusted to kill you if they're well paid. The Yunkish are paying them well.,8,3,17

2778,jorah, m,jorah," I was in King's Landing after the sack, khaleesi. You know what I saw? Butchery. Babies, children, old men. More women raped than you can count. There's a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand. But the Unsullied are not men. They do not rape. They do not put cities to the sword unless they're ordered to do so. If you buy them, the only men they'll kill are those you want dead.",3,3,81

2784,jorah, m,jorah, Do those people have any better ideas about how to put you on the Iron Throne?,1,3,16
2785,jorah, m,jorah, You're right. Another lovely day on the high seas.,1,3,9

2791,jorah, m,jorah, You'll be fair to them. You won't mutilate them to make a point.,1,3,13
2792,jorah, m,jorah, You won't order them to murder babies. You'll see they're properly fed and sheltered. A great injustice has been done to them. Closing your eyes will not undo it.,1,3,29

2804,jorah, m,jorah, Which men do you have in mind?,5,3,7
2805,jorah, m,jorah, It suffered for a reason. I sold men into slavery.,5,3,10
2806,jorah, m,jorah," Our cause? Forgive me, Ser Barristan, but I was busy defending the khaleesi against King Robert's assassins while you were still bowing to the man.",5,3,25
2807,jorah, m,jorah, You only joined us a few days ago. I can't speak to your intentions.,5,3,14
2808,jorah, m,jorah, You're not Lord here. You're just another exile. And I take my orders from the queen.,5,3,16
2809,jorah, m,jorah, Yunkai. The Yellow City.,7,3,4
2810,jorah, m,jorah," On the field, with ease. But they won't meet us on the field. They have provisions, patience, and strong walls. If they're wise, they'll hide behind those walls and chip away at us, man by man.",7,3,36

2820,jorah, m,jorah, The Lannisters have more.,5,4,4
2821,jorah, m,jorah," It's hard to say. It could be enough. But we're not fighting to make you queen of King's Landing. 10,000 men can't conquer Westeros.",5,4,24
2822,jorah, m,jorah," The old houses will flock to whichever side they think will win, as they always have.",5,4,16
2823,jorah, m,jorah," There's other news. From Yunkai. Without the Unsullied to enforce your rule, the Wise Masters have retaken control of the city. They've reenslaved the freedmen who stayed behind and sworn to take revenge against you. And in Astapor, the council you installed to rule over the city has been overthrown by a butcher named Cleon who's declared himself ""His Imperial Majesty.""",5,4,61
2824,jorah, m,jorah, You could sail for Westeros and leave it all behind. A boy sits on the Iron Throne. A boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it. They've never been more vulnerable.,5,4,35

2833,jorah, m,jorah, I did.,7,4,2
2834,jorah, m,jorah, Daario Naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands. How could you ever have faith in a man like that?,7,4,30
2835,jorah, m,jorah, You have?,7,4,2
2836,jorah, m,jorah," Without you there to rule, Khaleesi, I fear the masters will simply bide their time, wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control.",7,4,24
2837,jorah, m,jorah," Herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts. The slaves you freed, brutality is all they've ever known. If you want them to know something else, you'll have to show it to them.",7,4,42

2848,jorah, m,jorah, I’ve been flogged if it makes you happy. I’m the best you’ve got. If I win at the Great Pit how much can you sell me for?,8,5,27
2849,jorah, m,jorah, Let me fight for her and I belong to you.,8,5,10
2850,jorah, m,jorah, Torgo Nudho.,10,5,2

Instead I found her. Daenerys. Alive and unhurt. Holding her baby dragons. Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?",6,5,55

3168,catelyn, f,catelyn," Every time he would leave for the capital or fight in a campaign, I'd see him off. 'Wait for me, little Cat,' he'd say. 'Wait for me and I'll come back to you.' And I would sit at this window every day when the sun came up, waiting. I wonder how many times did Bran or Rickon stare across the moors of Winterfell waiting for me to return. I will never see them again.",3,3,74
3169,catelyn, f,catelyn, (Sighs.),3,3,1
3170,catelyn, f,catelyn, I hadn't seen him in years. I don't even know how many.,2,3,12
3171,catelyn, f,catelyn, Will I be wearing manacles when I lay my father to rest?,2,3,12
3172,catelyn, f,catelyn, Something else?,2,3,2

3174,catelyn, f,catelyn, Have you heard anything from Theon at all?,2,3,8
3175,catelyn, f,catelyn, You're afraid of her. And she knows it.,2,3,8
3176,catelyn, f,catelyn, No.,2,3,1
3177,catelyn, f,catelyn, You can't help because a mother makes one for her children to protect them. Only a mother can make them.,2,3,20
3178,catelyn, f,catelyn,  Twice.,2,3,1
3179,catelyn, f,catelyn,  After a fashion. I prayed for my son  Bran to survive his fall.,2,3,13
3180,catelyn, f,catelyn," Many years before that, one of the boys came down with the pox. Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, he'd live. But it would be a very long night. So I sat with him all through the darkness. Listened to his ragged little breaths, his coughing, his whimpering.",2,3,52
3181,catelyn, f,catelyn," Jon Snow. When my husband brought that baby home from the war, I couldn't bear to look at him. I didn't want to see those brown stranger's eyes staring up at me. So I prayed to the gods, take him away. Make him die. He got the pox. And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived. A murderer. I'd condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother. A woman he didn't even know. So I prayed to all seven gods, let the boy live. Let him live and I'll love him. I'll be a mother to him. I'll beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us.",2,3,134
3182,catelyn, f,catelyn, And he lived. And I couldn't keep my promise. And everything that's happened since then all this horror that's come to my family it's all because I couldn't love a motherless child.,2,3,32
3183,catelyn, f,catelyn, Ser Jeremy. My father's bannerman.,1,3,5
3184,catelyn, f,catelyn, The Karstarks are Northmen. They won't forgive the killing of their lord.,5,3,12

3197,catelyn, f,catelyn, Robb,8,2,1

3199,catelyn, f,catelyn,"  I grieve for your sons, my lord.",8,2,7
3200,catelyn, f,catelyn," Killing Jaime Lannister would not buy life for your children, but returning him to King's Landing may buy life for mine.",8,2,21
3201,catelyn, f,catelyn, Robb. How many men did we send in pursuit of the Kingslayer?,8,2,12
3202,catelyn, f,catelyn, Robb.,8,2,1
3203,catelyn, f,catelyn, Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross.,10,2,8

3205,catelyn, f,catelyn, I know that seems important to you.,10,2,7
3206,catelyn, f,catelyn," Your father didn't love me when we married. He hardly knew me or I him. Love didn't just happen to us. We built it slowly over the years, stone by stone, for you, for your brothers and sisters, for all of us. It's not as exciting as secret passion in the woods, but it is stronger. It lasts longer.",10,2,59
3207,catelyn, f,catelyn, Why not? Because she's not beautiful? Because she's not exotic and exciting?,10,2,12
3208,catelyn, f,catelyn," And you agreed to it. You gave him your word. Treat your oaths recklessly, and your people will do the same. If your father lived his life for one thing",10,2,30

3215,catelyn, f,catelyn, Because it won't last. Because they are the knights of summer and winter is coming.,3,2,15
3216,catelyn, f,catelyn," You fought bravely today, Lady Brienne.",3,2,6
3217,catelyn, f,catelyn, You don’t want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.,2,2,8
3218,catelyn, f,catelyn, He is not trustworthy!,2,2,4
3219,catelyn, f,catelyn, You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.,1,2,8
3220,catelyn, f,catelyn, They say a million rats live in the sewers of King's Landing. Shall we rally them to fight for us?,1,2,20
3221,catelyn, f,catelyn, I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because he is not trustworthy. Your father had to go to war to end his rebellion.,1,2,21
3222,catelyn, f,catelyn," I mothered more than just rebels, a fact you seem to have forgotten.",1,2,13
3223,catelyn, f,catelyn," You want to leave Sansa in the Queen's hands? And Arya, I haven't heard a word about Arya. What are we fighting for if not for them?",1,2,27
3224,catelyn, f,catelyn, It's time for me to go home. I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.,1,2,15
3225,catelyn, f,catelyn, I beg your pardon?,1,2,4
3226,catelyn, f,catelyn, Why in the name of all the Gods -,1,2,9
3227,catelyn, f,catelyn, I haven't seen Renly Baratheon since he was a boy. You have a hundred other lords -,1,2,17
3228,catelyn, f,catelyn, I will ride at first light.,1,2,6
3229,catelyn, f,catelyn, You've done so well. Your father would be proud.,1,2,9
3230,catelyn, f,catelyn, King Renly. There's a king in every corner now.,1,2,9
3231,catelyn, f,catelyn, By the mother. My son has no interest in the Iron Throne.,5,2,12
3232,catelyn, f,catelyn, And the wording of this oath?,5,2,6
3233,catelyn, f,catelyn, And in return for my son's loyalty?,5,2,7

3238,catelyn, f,catelyn, To me it just looked like... A shadow in the shape of a man.,5,2,14
3239,catelyn, f,catelyn,  We should reach my son's camp tomorrow.,5,2,7
3240,catelyn, f,catelyn," Only long enough to tell Robb what I have seen. After that, I will leave for Winterfell. My two youngest need me. I've been away from them for far too long.",5,2,31
3241,catelyn, f,catelyn, I'm sorry.,5,2,2

3245,catelyn, f,catelyn, But Stannis has a great army around him. His own guards are sworn to keep him safe.,5,2,17
3246,catelyn, f,catelyn, I'm as good as any of them. I should never have fled.,5,2,12
3247,catelyn, f,catelyn, Renly's death was no fault of yours. You served him bravely.,5,2,11
3248,catelyn, f,catelyn," He's gone, Brienne. You serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth. Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well.",5,2,22
3249,catelyn, f,catelyn," When the time comes, I will not hold you back.",5,2,10
3250,catelyn, f,catelyn,  I vow that you shall always have a place in my home and at my table and that I shall ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.,5,2,40

3257,catelyn, f,catelyn, What do you want?,4,2,4
3258,catelyn, f,catelyn, Of course they will. Jaime Lannister for two girls? Robb will never agree to those terms.,4,2,16
3259,catelyn, f,catelyn, You think I keep secrets from my son?,4,2,8
3260,catelyn, f,catelyn, I don't want your gifts. A token of Tyrion Lannister's goodwill. He wants you to understand that this exchange of prisoners is offered in good faith.,4,2,26
3261,catelyn, f,catelyn, Good faith?,4,2,2
3262,catelyn, f,catelyn, What's this?,4,2,2

3387,catelyn, f,catelyn,  No!,2,1,1
3388,catelyn, f,catelyn,  What I am about to tell you must remain between us. I don't think Bran fell from that tower. I think he was thrown.,2,1,24
3389,catelyn, f,catelyn, Someone tried to kill him twice. Why? Why murder an innocent child? Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.,2,1,21
3390,catelyn, f,catelyn, I don't know. But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved. We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.,2,1,24
3391,catelyn, f,catelyn,  I don't trust a raven to carry these words.,2,1,9
3392,catelyn, f,catelyn,  No. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. I will go myself.,2,1,13
3393,catelyn, f,catelyn, I must.,2,1,2

3401,catelyn, f,catelyn, There was a raven from Kings Landing. Jon Arryn is dead. A fever took him. I know he was like a father to you.,1,1,24
3402,catelyn, f,catelyn, They both have their health. Gods be good. [pause] The raven brought more news. The king rides for Winterfell. With the queen and all the rest of them.,1,1,28

3414,catelyn, f,catelyn, Hush now. Your father hasn’t even said yes.,1,1,8
3415,catelyn, f,catelyn, He’d have to leave home. He’d have to leave me. And so would you.,1,1,14
3416,catelyn, f,catelyn, Sansa…,1,1,1
3417,catelyn, f,catelyn," I’m sure it’s very grim, after Kings Landing. I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time.",1,1,24

3423,catelyn, f,catelyn, She’s fled the capital. She says Jon Arryn was murdered. By the Lannisters. She says the king is in danger.,1,1,20
3424,catelyn, f,catelyn," Lysa’s head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter. Do you think she would risk her life, her son’s life, if she wasn’t certain her husband was murdered?",1,1,36
3425,catelyn, f,catelyn, They murdered the last Hand. Now you want Ned to take the job.,1,1,13
3426,catelyn, f,catelyn, He spent half his life fighting Robert’s wars. He owes him nothing. (To NED) Your father and brother rode south once on a king’s demand.,1,1,25
3427,catelyn, f,catelyn, Remove his hood.,5,1,3
3428,catelyn, f,catelyn, I did... often and loudly.,5,1,5

3435,catelyn, f,catelyn, To whom do I speak?,5,1,5
3436,catelyn, f,catelyn, There was no time to send word.,5,1,7
3437,catelyn, f,catelyn, That's why there was no time. He is my prisoner.,5,1,10

3439,catelyn, f,catelyn," Lysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters, warning me t-",5,1,10

3442,catelyn, f,catelyn," I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I stayed here. You, Ser... Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your coat?",4,1,26
3443,catelyn, f,catelyn, And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father... Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?,4,1,17
3444,catelyn, f,catelyn, The red stallion was always a welcome sight at Riverrun. My father counts Jonas Bracken amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen.,4,1,22
3445,catelyn, f,catelyn," This man... Came into my house as a guest and there conspired to murder my son, a boy of 10. In the name of King Robert and the good Lords you serve, I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the king's justice.",4,1,51
3446,catelyn, f,catelyn," Lord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder my sister’s husband; Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King.",6,1,33

3474,talisa, f,talisa, You're lucky to be alive.,1,3,5
3475,talisa, f,talisa," Your mother's right. If you do this, the Karstarks will abandon you.",5,3,12
3476,talisa, f,talisa, And more boys will keep dying until this war is over. You need Karstark men to end it.,5,3,18

3517,talisa, f,talisa," When I was 12, my mother and father went to a wedding. Weddings in Volantis last for days, you know. And they left me with my little brother. The second afternoon they were gone was the hottest day in the three-year summer. We couldn't bear to be inside, so we ran down to the Rhoyne. Every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day. The rich, the poor, we were all there. Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands. Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank. I was treading water, talking to a friend, when I realized I hadn't seen my brother. I called his name. Then I started screaming his name. And then I saw him floating face down. My heart just stopped. I was I dragged him from the water. My friend helped me, I think. I don't even remember. He was so little. Then we pulled him onto the riverbank. And I screamed at him and I shook him. And he was dead. Just dead. A man ran over. He had a fish tattoo on his face. In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos. So you know what they are without having to talk to them. And this man worked on a fishing boat. And he pushed me out of the way. You have to understand, for a slave to push a highborn girl, that's death for the man, a terrible death. But he pushed me out of the way, and he started pressing on my brother's chest again and again and again, until my brother spat out half of the Rhoyne and cried out. And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm. I decided two things that day. I would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies. And when I came of age, I would never live in a slave city again. I'm sorry, Your Grace. You told me of your problems and I've blathered on.",8,2,332

3529,talisa, f,talisa, That boy did?,4,2,3
3530,talisa, f,talisa, Do you think he's friends with King Joffrey? He's a fisherman's son that grew up near Lannisport. He probably never held a spear before they shoved one in his hands a few months ago.,4,2,34

The realms of men. That means her as well as us. We didn't build 500 miles of ice walls 700 feet high to keep men out. The night is gathering, Maester Aemon. I've seen it. It's coming for all of us.",10,3,75

3614,sam, m,sam, Gilly.,4,3,1
3615,sam, m,sam, I wanted you to have it.,4,3,6
3616,sam, m,sam, Craster's got his daughters to feed.,4,3,6

3622,sam, m,sam," It doesn't get so cold down in the Reach. And there were servants, of course.",6,3,15

3624,sam, m,sam," I'm not sure that it does anything. It's beautiful, though, isn't it?",6,3,12
3625,sam, m,sam, Not so far. A few more days.,6,3,7
3626,sam, m,sam, Bigger. So big you can't even see the top sometimes. It's hidden in clouds.,6,3,14
3627,sam, m,sam," I'm not. It's 700 feet high, all made of ice. On a warm day you can see it weeping. Castle Black is nice enough. They keep a fire burning in the long hall day and night. And Hobb makes venison stew with onions. Very tasty. Sometimes, one of the brothers will sing. Dareon sings best.",6,3,55

3632,sam, m,sam, Oh? How big were her feet?,9,4,6
3633,sam, m,sam, I want you to tell me what it was like to have someone. To be with someone. To love someone and have them love you back. We're all gonna die a lot sooner than I'd planned. You're the closest I'll ever get to know it.,9,4,45
3634,sam, m,sam, No...she just had a baby! ...and she never offered.,9,4,9

3659,sam, m,sam, I'm not leaving you!,9,4,4
3660,sam, m,sam, I...I didn't mean in the same room.,9,4,7
3661,sam, m,sam, Help my brothers.,9,4,3
3662,sam, m,sam, I can't just hide here with you while they're fighting out there.,9,4,12
3663,sam, m,sam," Look. I am a man of the Night's Watch, Gilly. I made a promise to defend The Wall and I have to keep it, because that's what men do.",9,4,29
3664,sam, m,sam, I promise you I won't die.,9,4,6
3665,sam, m,sam, There's a lot more Wildlings on the other side of the wall than this side. We've got us some weapons and things. This is the perfect place for us to be.,9,4,31
3666,sam, m,sam," Of course I'm afraid, there's a band of Wildlings coming to kill us.",9,4,13
3667,sam, m,sam," I didn't know I was going to kill it, but I had to do something I didn't have any choice, he was going to kill Gilly and take the baby. If someone had asked me my name right then, I wouldn't have known. I wasn't Samwell Tarly anymore. I wasn't a Steward in the Night's Watch or son of Randyll Tarly or any of that. I was nothing at all. And when you're nothing at all, there's no more reason to be afraid.",9,4,83

3675,sam, m,sam, *to Grenn* We need more men down here.,9,4,8
3676,sam, m,sam, But we need men here.,9,4,5
3677,sam, m,sam, *to Olly* Get me to the top! You hear me?!,9,4,10
3678,sam, m,sam," Your name's Olly, right? Listen to me Olly, get me to the top and when we give a signal, bring us back down. Do you hear me?",9,4,27
3679,sam, m,sam," And find a weapon, Olly. Fight them!",9,4,7
3680,sam, m,sam, The Wildlings are over the walls. Ser Alliser has fallen. The castle walls can't stand much longer.,9,4,17
3681,sam, m,sam, You can't protect me forever. There won't be anywhere to hide if the castle falls.,9,4,15
3682,sam, m,sam, We need you boy.,9,4,4
3683,sam, m,sam," Woah! It's me. It's me. I promised you, didn't I?",9,4,10
3684,sam, m,sam, We held them off.,9,4,4

3687,sam, m,sam, To...you can't do that. No one gave you any orders.,9,4,10
3688,sam, m,sam, Without Mance? You're going to kill him?,9,4,7
3689,sam, m,sam," They'll never let you within a hundred yards of him. And if you did, even if you managed to kill him.",9,4,21
3690,sam, m,sam, He won't just kill ya. They'll boil you. They'll filet you. They'll make it last days!,9,4,16
3691,sam, m,sam, What are you doing?,9,4,4
3692,sam, m,sam, Jon. Come back.,9,4,3
3693,sam, m,sam, I should never have left her there.,8,4,7
3694,sam, m,sam, Of course I could've known. They were raiding the villages close by.,8,4,12
3695,sam, m,sam, She's dead because of me.,8,4,5
3696,sam, m,sam, Little Same. As if I'd cut their throats myself.,8,4,9
3697,sam, m,sam, She might have.,8,4,3
3698,sam, m,sam, She's not a whore.,3,4,4
3699,sam, m,sam, They all think I'm lying.,3,4,5
3700,sam, m,sam, Killing the white Walker.,3,4,4
3701,sam, m,sam, But you're the only one that saw it. And they all think you're just a...,3,4,15
3702,sam, m,sam," Well, a wildling.",3,4,3
3703,sam, m,sam," It's not a very nice word, I suppose.",3,4,8
3704,sam, m,sam, So... are you all right? No one bothering you?,3,4,9
3705,sam, m,sam, I worry about it sometimes. All the time.,3,4,8
3706,sam, m,sam," 100 men, one woman.",3,4,4
3707,sam, m,sam, That's the only thing they think about.,3,4,7
3708,sam, m,sam,  I'm not being silly. There's 100 men lying awake at night picturing you.,3,4,13
3709,sam, m,sam, What about me? Gilly? I worry about you.,3,4,8
3710,sam, m,sam, For what?,3,4,2
3711,sam, m,sam," I don't know if you're safe here. They're my brothers, but some of them were thieves before they came here. Some of them were rapers. You saw what they did at your father's keep.",3,4,34
3712,sam, m,sam, Maybe you'd be safer in Mole's Town.,3,4,7
3713,sam, m,sam, Bored of you? I... I want to protect you.,3,4,9
3714,sam, m,sam," He's seen some adventures, hasn't he?",3,4,6
3715,sam, m,sam, That's right. She'll clean and cook and look after the other girls' babies.,3,4,13
3716,sam, m,sam, No other work.,3,4,3
3717,sam, m,sam, No other work.,3,4,3
3718,sam, m,sam, I promise to come back and visit whenever I can. You'll be safer here. Who's gonna protect you at Castle Black? Me?,3,4,22
3719,sam, m,sam," This is different. They're brothers of the Night's Watch and I can't just stab them in the back and I can't run away, which is what we did at Craster's.",3,4,30
3720,sam, m,sam, You have to trust me. It's for the best.,3,4,9
3721,sam, m,sam," Oh, Gilly. Please don't.",3,4,4
3722,sam, m,sam, Sometimes I want to hate you.,1,4,6
3723,sam, m,sam," Well, you're better than me at everything. Except reading.",1,4,9
3724,sam, m,sam, They're... they're ready for you.,1,4,5
3725,sam, m,sam, No one's going to hang you. You've done nothing wrong.,1,4,10
3726,sam, m,sam, I should neverhave taken her away.,4,4,6
3727,sam, m,sam," She's not safe out there. I should have known. You told us there were wildlings south of the Wall. If they're raiding the smaller villages, Mole's Town could be next.",4,4,30
3728,sam, m,sam, I should go back for Gilly.,4,4,6
3729,sam, m,sam, I remember when you disobeyed orders and rode south to help Robb.,4,4,12
3730,sam, m,sam," I wish I could have convinced him to come back with me. I tried. Really, I did.",4,4,17
3731,sam, m,sam, I don't know. They'd pass wildling villages. They could try to find shelter at one of them.,4,4,17
3732,sam, m,sam, Craster's? You think Bra nmight have found...,4,4,7
3733,sam, m,sam," All right, Jon?",7,4,3
3734,sam, m,sam, It wasn’t.,9,5,2
3735,sam, m,sam," You didn’t fail him, or him, or her. Every one of them is alive because of you, and no one else.",9,5,21
3736,sam, m,sam, No.,8,5,1
3737,sam, m,sam, How are you?,8,5,3
3738,sam, m,sam, You know what I mean.,8,5,5
3739,sam, m,sam, Are you scared?,8,5,3
3740,sam, m,sam, Me too.,8,5,2
3741,sam, m,sam, Who’s there?,8,5,2
3742,sam, m,sam, Come in.,8,5,2
3743,sam, m,sam, Not to worry. Men brawl from time to time. It’s only natural.,8,5,12
3744,sam, m,sam, You’re a good lad.,8,5,4
3745,sam, m,sam, Now then. How can I help?,8,5,6
3746,sam, m,sam, Yes?,8,5,1
3747,sam, m,sam, We’ve been fighting them for years.,8,5,6
3748,sam, m,sam," Wildlings are people, just like us. There are good ones and bad ones.",8,5,13
3749,sam, m,sam, Olly...,8,5,1
3750,sam, m,sam," I’ve seen the army of the dead. I’ve seen the white walkers, and they’re coming for us, for all the living. And when it’s time we’ll need every last man we can find.",8,5,33
3751,sam, m,sam," Jon’s taking a risk, but he has to. We don’t stand a chance otherwise. Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others but you know are right in the long run.",8,5,38
3752,sam, m,sam, With all my heart.,8,5,4
3753,sam, m,sam, Try not to worry Olly. I’ve been worrying about Jon for years. He always comes back.,8,5,16
3754,sam, m,sam, So what are you gonna do?,10,5,6
3755,sam, m,sam, But… the Dragonglass?,10,5,3
3756,sam, m,sam, But… you killed a White Walker.,10,5,6
3757,sam, m,sam, He’s made of Valyrian steel. How many Valyrian steel swords are left in the Seven Kingdoms?,10,5,16
3758,sam, m,sam, You were friends with me when I first got here. And I wasn’t winning any elections back then.,10,5,18
3759,sam, m,sam," I wanted to ask you something. To ask something of you. Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown so I can become a Maester. That’s what I’m meant to be, not this.",10,5,33
3760,sam, m,sam," Well, there’s Edd.",10,5,3
3761,sam, m,sam," I’ll be more use to you as a Maester. More use to everyone now that Maester Aemon’s gone. The Citadel has the world’s greatest library. I’ll learn about history, strategy, healing. And other things. Things that will help when they come.",10,5,41
3762,sam, m,sam," If Gilly stays here then she’ll die. And the baby that she named after me will die. And I’ll end up dying, too, trying to protect them. Which means that the last thing that I’ll see in this world will be the look in her eyes when I fail them. (pause) I’d rather see a thousand White Walkers than see that.",10,5,61
3763,sam, m,sam, Thank you.,10,5,2
3764,sam, m,sam, They’ll bloody try.,10,5,3
3765,sam, m,sam, What?,10,5,1
3766,sam, m,sam, Very carefully.,10,5,2
3767,sam, m,sam, I’ll come back.,10,5,3
3768,sam, m,sam, To my return.,10,5,3
3769,sam, m,sam, He apologizes for not being here. He's not feeling well.,3,5,10
3770,sam, m,sam," Alright, alright! Enough of that.",3,5,5
3771,sam, m,sam," Hmm! Did you know that the youngest Lord Commander in history, Osric Stark, was elected at the age of 10?",2,5,20
3772,sam, m,sam," I only said that the more time you spend practicing, the faster you'll be able to read.",2,5,17
3773,sam, m,sam," Three?! Who taught you, your mother?",2,5,6
3774,sam, m,sam, Did you ever see them?,2,5,5
3775,sam, m,sam, Your Grace.,2,5,2
3776,sam, m,sam, He'll make you a Stark with the stroke of a pen?,2,5,11
3777,sam, m,sam, You deserve this. You do. I couldn't be happier for you.,2,5,11
3778,sam, m,sam, But you'd be Lord of Winterfell.,2,5,6
3779,sam, m,sam, Maester Aemon.,2,5,2
3780,sam, m,sam, Her name is Gilly. Brother Slynt knows her quite well. They cowered together in the larder during the battle for the Wall.,2,5,22

3783,sam, m,sam," Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true. And when he was wounded, it is Jon who saved us. He took charge of the wall's defense. He killed the Magnar of the Thenns. (a man next to Sam nods) He went North to deal with Mance Rayder, knowing it almost certainly meant his own death. Before that, he led the mission to avenge Lord Commander Mormont. Mormont himself chose Jon to be his steward. He saw something in Jon, and now we've all seen it, too. He may be young, but he's the commander we turned to when the night was darkest.",2,5,101
3784,sam, m,sam," Well, I’m hardly a new recruit. How many brothers can say they’ve killed a white walker and a Thenn? I might be the first in history!",1,5,26

3786,sam, m,sam, All the wildlings.,1,5,3

3791,sam, m,sam, (Standing up) There is good farmland in the Gift. (Laughter). Land that no one uses now. A dozen abandoned villages.,5,5,20

3798,sam, m,sam, It's where they train the maesters.,5,5,6

He was the blood of the dragon, but now his fire has gone out. And now his watch has ended.",7,5,81
3821,sam, m,sam, Get your hands off her. Brother Derryk. Brother Brand. I believe you both have guard duty tonight.,7,5,17
3822,sam, m,sam," Gilly go on, Get back to your room and lock the door.",7,5,12
3823,sam, m,sam, I’m warning you.,7,5,3
3824,sam, m,sam, I said get your hands off her.,7,5,7
3825,sam, m,sam, I killed a White Walker. I killed a Thenn. I’ll take my chances with you.,7,5,15
3826,sam, m,sam, I’m alright.,7,5,2
3827,sam, m,sam, I will not. They would’ve… I don’t know what they would have done,7,5,13
3828,sam, m,sam, No. They were tiring out. I had them in the palm of my hand.,7,5,14
3829,sam, m,sam, What kind of man would I be if I ran away when I saw someone hurting you?,7,5,17
3830,sam, m,sam," Of course I will. And I’ll take care of you, too.",7,5,11
3831,sam, m,sam, Stay. Please.,7,5,2
3832,sam, m,sam, Oh. Oh my.,7,5,3
3833,sam, m,sam, (panting) I'm not cut out for this sort of work.,8,2,10
3834,sam, m,sam, Where do you think Jon is right now?,8,2,8
3835,sam, m,sam," He's not dead. No, Jon's a great fighter.",8,2,8
3836,sam, m,sam, He's got a Valyrian steel sword.,8,2,6
3837,sam, m,sam, And Qhorin Halfhand is the greatest ranger alive.,8,2,8
3838,sam, m,sam, The First Men made these marks. Help me with it.,8,2,10
3839,sam, m,sam, That's a Night's Watch cloak.,8,2,5
3840,sam, m,sam, Oh. Must be dragonglass.,8,2,4
3841,sam, m,sam, The maesters call it obsidian.,8,2,5
3842,sam, m,sam," If you step back and think about it, the thing about Gilly that's so interesting is",10,2,16
3843,sam, m,sam," No, truly. The thing about her that I find so interesting is that after all that Craster's done to her, she's still got hope that life might get better.",10,2,29
3844,sam, m,sam, And the thing about you that I find so interesting is absolutely nothing.,10,2,13
3845,sam, m,sam, It's Jon and the Halfhand. They're back.,10,2,7
3846,sam, m,sam, Wait! Wait for me!,10,2,4
3847,sam, m,sam, Grenn!,10,2,1

3849,sam, m,sam, Lord Commander,3,2,2
3850,sam, m,sam, Gilly.,3,2,1
3851,sam, m,sam, I I wanted to give you something. It belonged to my mother.,3,2,12
3852,sam, m,sam, Please. I want you to. My mother used it for sewing. She'd let me sit with her in her chamber while she sewed and I'd read to her. My father put a stop to it when he found out. It's the only thing I have of hers. She gave it to me before I left for the Wall.,3,2,58
3853,sam, m,sam, I'm not giving it away. I'm giving it to you. Keep it safe for me. Till I come back.,3,2,19
3854,sam, m,sam," Seems a bit greedy for one man to have so many wives. Wouldn't two, or three, be enough for him?",2,2,20
3855,sam, m,sam, Nothing like the sight of a woman walking away.,2,2,9
3856,sam, m,sam, I'm sure that's nice too.,2,2,5
3857,sam, m,sam, You were with her? How many times?,2,2,7
3858,sam, m,sam, Wish I'd grew up on a farm.,2,2,7
3859,sam, m,sam," Oh, oh. Right. I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure you weren't hurt. (Long pause).",2,2,16
3860,sam, m,sam," This is Gilly, she's one of Craster's daughters.",2,2,8
3861,sam, m,sam," She's pregnant. (Gilly encourages Sam to continue). We have to take her with us, when we leave.",2,2,17
3862,sam, m,sam, I know it sounds a bit mad.,2,2,7
3863,sam, m,sam," The Lord Commander, (Jon tries and fails to interrupt Sam), we are sworn to protect -",2,2,16
3864,sam, m,sam, Why did you do that?,2,2,5
3865,sam, m,sam, You were cruel.,2,2,3
3866,sam, m,sam, I didn't touch her!,2,2,4
3867,sam, m,sam," I can't steal her, she's a person not a goat.",2,2,10
3868,sam, m,sam," I could try. (Jon looks down, annoyed). What? I've read about it. A bit.",2,2,14
3869,sam, m,sam, Nothing's killed me yet.,1,2,4
3870,sam, m,sam, You offered me a ride!,1,2,5
3871,sam, m,sam, Are those girls?,1,2,3
3872,sam, m,sam, I haven't seen a girl in six months.,1,2,8
3873,sam, m,sam, That's foul.,1,2,2
3874,sam, m,sam, Hmm?,1,2,1
3875,sam, m,sam," Beautiful, isn't it? Gilly would love it here.",5,2,8
3876,sam, m,sam," The Fist of the First Men. Think of how old this place is. Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals, before the Andals took Westeros from the First Men.",5,2,28
3877,sam, m,sam," Thousands and thousands of years ago, the First Men stood here where we're standing all through the long night. What do you think they were like, the First Men?",5,2,29
3878,sam, m,sam," And three for White Walkers. It's been a thousand years, but that's the only time they blow the horn three times.",5,2,21
3879,sam, m,sam, Well I read it in a book.,5,2,7
3880,sam, m,sam, I don't see very well.,5,2,5
3881,sam, m,sam," I could take up Jon's duties while he's gone, my lord. It would be no trouble.",5,2,16
3882,sam, m,sam," Archmaester, I was wondering...",1,7,4
3883,sam, m,sam," Um, 147.",1,7,2
3884,sam, m,sam, I was wondering if you had considered my proposition.,1,7,9
3885,sam, m,sam," I asked you if, in light of what I've seen in the North, if I could have access to the restricted area of the library.",1,7,25
3886,sam, m,sam, No.,1,7,1
3887,sam, m,sam," Archmaester, with respect, I've seen them--the Army of the Dead. The white walkers. W was sent here to learn how to defeat them, but everyone in the Citadel, those who will even talk to me, they all doubt the walkers ever existed in the first place.",1,7,46
3888,sam, m,sam, Sources in the restricted area?,1,7,5
3889,sam, m,sam," So, you believe me.",1,7,4
3890,sam, m,sam, That makes you the only person south of the Twins who does.,1,7,12
3891,sam, m,sam, The dead don't.,1,7,3
3892,sam, m,sam, The Targaryens used dragonglass to decorate their weapons without even knowing what the First Men used it for.,1,7,18
3893,sam, m,sam, It's a map of Dragonstone. The Targaryens built their first stronghold there when they invaded Westeros.,1,7,16
3894,sam, m,sam," A mountain of it. Beneath the ground. Stannis told me, but I didn't think... This is important. Jon needs to know.",1,7,21
3895,sam, m,sam, Who?,1,7,1
3896,sam, m,sam, Haven't heard anything.,1,7,3
3897,sam, m,sam,  No.,5,7,1
3898,sam, m,sam, I wasn't sure if you'd remember me.,7,7,7
3899,sam, m,sam," Oh, well, thank you, but, um, I'm not sure that I am. What happened to you beyond the Wall?",7,7,19
3900,sam, m,sam, Oh! I don't know what that means.,7,7,7
3901,sam, m,sam," Um, Jon's the one to lead the fight against the dead. I know he is. But he can't do it alone, so I've come here to help him.",7,7,28
3902,sam, m,sam, Oh.,7,7,1
3903,sam, m,sam, The truth about what?,7,7,4
3904,sam, m,sam, It's not.,7,7,2
3905,sam, m,sam," At the Citadel, I transcribed a High Septon's diary. He annulled Rhaegar's marriage to Elia. He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna in a secret ceremony.",7,7,24
3906,sam, m,sam,  It's what the High Septon wrote in his private diary. I don't know why he'd lie. Is this something you can see?,7,7,22
3907,sam, m,sam," (to GENDRY) Uh, hold on.",4,8,5
3908,sam, m,sam," Yes, well, the nights have been getting longer and there wasn't that much to do in Oldtown. There's only so many books a person can read, so we--",4,8,28
3909,sam, m,sam, You're the best friend I ever had.,4,8,7
3910,sam, m,sam, Why just us?,6,8,3
3911,sam, m,sam, Aye.,6,8,1
3912,sam, m,sam, A Song of Ice and Fire. Archmaester Ebrose's history of the wars following the death of King Robert. I helped him with the title.,6,8,24
3913,sam, m,sam," Oh, I wouldn't say that.",6,8,5
3914,sam, m,sam,  He -,6,8,2
3915,sam, m,sam," I don't believe you're mentioned, ahem.",6,8,6
3916,sam, m,sam, Your Grace.,6,8,2
3917,sam, m,sam," He was last spotted flying east, toward--",6,8,7
3918,sam, m,sam,  Long may he reign.,6,8,4
3919,sam, m,sam," Grandmaester, ahem, it is my theory, based on my years of work on the Casterly Rock sewers, that clean water leads to a healthier population.",6,8,25
3920,sam, m,sam, The Archmaester has done some research on this subject and it turns out--,6,8,13
3921,sam, m,sam, Uh the Archmaester is less than enthusiastic about the salutary effects of brothels.,6,8,13
3922,sam, m,sam, Hello.,10,6,1
3923,sam, m,sam, From Lord Commander Snow at Castle Black.,10,6,7
3924,sam, m,sam, He died.,10,6,2
3925,sam, m,sam, Maester Aemon became quite ill shortly after the election. He’s since passed away. Which is why I’m here.,10,6,18
3926,sam, m,sam," Yes, well, I suppose that life is irregular.",10,6,8
3927,sam, m,sam," Oh, yes. Once you get south of the Riverlands, very different sorts of trees start to take over. Maple, elm, beech, poplar. The odd willow. And of course now that summer’s over, you’ll start seeing the autumn colors coming in. Still, you’ll find more green here than anywhere else.",6,6,49
3928,sam, m,sam," I didn’t think I’d ever come back here after my father made me renounce my title and inheritance and, well, threaten to kill me if I didn’t. A person just doesn’t feel welcome at that point.",6,6,36
3929,sam, m,sam, And I certainly didn’t expect to be introducing him to my family. So you know what to tell them.,6,6,19
3930,sam, m,sam," Yes, now that’s very important. If he thinks that Little Sam is his grandchild, he’ll take you in. He’ll get an education. He’ll learn to read. And you can help teach him. Huh?",6,6,33
3931,sam, m,sam, I told them I met you in the North.,6,6,9
3932,sam, m,sam," Well, it wasn’t a very large piece of parchment.",6,6,9
3933,sam, m,sam," The thing is...my father doesn’t like wildlings. He hoped I’d make a man of myself by “killing some bloody wildlings,” so it’s probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible.",6,6,32
3934,sam, m,sam," Oh, hello, Mother.",6,6,3
3935,sam, m,sam, Oh.,6,6,1
3936,sam, m,sam," Talla? Gods, you’re a woman now.",6,6,6
3937,sam, m,sam," Oh, um, Mother, this is Gilly.",6,6,6
3938,sam, m,sam," Oh, and this, this is our son Samwell.",6,6,8
3939,sam, m,sam, Where is Father? And Dickon?,6,6,5
3940,sam, m,sam, It’s beautiful. You’re beautiful.,6,6,4
3941,sam, m,sam," This venison, it’s very tasty. Is it from today’s hunt?",6,6,10
3942,sam, m,sam," Oh, of course. Sorry. Long journey.",6,6,6
3943,sam, m,sam," Oh, that’s a fair distance.",6,6,5
3944,sam, m,sam," Oh, yes. Yes. A good amount. North of the Wall, you don’t hunt, you don’t eat.",6,6,16
3945,sam, m,sam," Oh, yes. Yes, please. Thank you, Mother.",6,6,7
3946,sam, m,sam," Yes. And once I have my chain, I’ll return to Castle Black.",6,6,12
3947,sam, m,sam, Gilly.,6,6,1
3948,sam, m,sam, I’m sorry I let him treat you that way. I was afraid he’d turn you and Little Sam away.,6,6,19
3949,sam, m,sam, First light.,6,6,2
3950,sam, m,sam, Say good-bye to him for me.,6,6,6
3951,sam, m,sam," Good-bye, Gilly.",6,6,2
3952,sam, m,sam, We’re leaving.,6,6,2
3953,sam, m,sam, Get your things.,6,6,3
3954,sam, m,sam, We belong together. All of us.,6,6,6
3955,sam, m,sam," Oh, they’ll understand.",6,6,3
3956,sam, m,sam, She won’t mind. Looks better on you anyway.,6,6,8
3957,sam, m,sam, It’s my family’s sword.,6,6,4
3958,sam, m,sam, He can bloody well try.,6,6,5
3959,ygritte, f,ygritte, How’s he keep folks from stealing them?,9,3,7
3960,ygritte, f,ygritte, He’s an old man.  A spear through the heart’s a better way to die than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear.,9,3,27
3961,ygritte, f,ygritte, [Looks at Jon]  Do it.  Do it.,9,3,7
3962,ygritte, f,ygritte, No!,9,3,1
3963,ygritte, f,ygritte, (grunts),10,3,1
3964,ygritte, f,ygritte," You know nothing, Jon Snow.",10,3,5
3965,ygritte, f,ygritte, You said there was dead crows.,3,3,6
3966,ygritte, f,ygritte," What, you've never met a warg?",2,3,6
3967,ygritte, f,ygritte," First time you've seen a giant, Jon Snow?",1,3,8
3968,ygritte, f,ygritte," Well, don't stare too long. They're shy. When they stop being shy, they get angry. And when they're angry, I've seen them pound a man straight into the ground like a hammer on a nail.",1,3,35
3969,ygritte, f,ygritte, You're wearing the wrong color.,1,3,5
3970,ygritte, f,ygritte," In your hearts, all you crows want to fly free.",1,3,10
3971,ygritte, f,ygritte," Sure, you will.",1,3,3
3972,ygritte, f,ygritte," And I'll be free to kill you. Got no respect, this lot. Got no fathers to slap 'em when they're foul.",1,3,21
3973,ygritte, f,ygritte," Some of them were killed by crows like you. Don't look so grim, Jon Snow. If Mance Rayder likes you, you'll live another day. And if he don't...",1,3,28
3974,ygritte, f,ygritte, This baby killed Qhorin Halfhand. He wants to be one of us.,1,3,12
3975,ygritte, f,ygritte, He's no crow.,5,3,3
3976,ygritte, f,ygritte, I'm not afraid of you.,5,3,5
3977,ygritte, f,ygritte, Of course you do. Who stopped Rattleshirt when he was about to cut your throat? Who vouched for you with Mance? It seems you owe me a debt.,5,3,28
3978,ygritte, f,ygritte," Well, I stole it. It's mine. If you want it, come steal it back.",5,3,14
3979,ygritte, f,ygritte, Is Orell right? Are you still a crow? It's time you proved yourself.,5,3,13
3980,ygritte, f,ygritte, You swore some vows. I want you to break 'em. I want you to see me.,5,3,16
3981,ygritte, f,ygritte, All of me.,5,3,3
3982,ygritte, f,ygritte, We should.,5,3,2
3983,ygritte, f,ygritte," Why are you still dressed? You know nothing, Jon Sno--",5,3,10
3984,ygritte, f,ygritte, Hmm.,5,3,1
3985,ygritte, f,ygritte," Aye, I liked it some. Who taught you that?",5,3,9
3986,ygritte, f,ygritte, A maid. You were a maid.,5,3,6
3987,ygritte, f,ygritte, What do you think?,5,3,4
3988,ygritte, f,ygritte," Just a boy. He came trading with his brothers. He had red hair like me. Kissed by fire. But he was weak. Not like you. That was the first one. Then there was this Thenn boy. Spoke no Common, but gods, he was built like a mammoth.",5,3,47
3989,ygritte, f,ygritte, I'm not done with you yet.,5,3,6
3990,ygritte, f,ygritte, How long's it been since you had a bath?,5,3,9
3991,ygritte, f,ygritte," Let's not go back. Let's stay here a while longer. I don't ever want to leave this cave, Jon Snow. Not ever.",5,3,22
3992,ygritte, f,ygritte, No. But Tormund's done it half a hundred times. You're afraid.,6,3,11
3993,ygritte, f,ygritte," Aye. It's a long way up and a long way down. But I've waited my whole life to see the world from up there. Here, sit down.",6,3,27
3994,ygritte, f,ygritte," I brought a pair for you. They're too big for you, but they're good.",6,3,14
3995,ygritte, f,ygritte," Nah. I didn't kill him, but I bet his balls are still bruised.",6,3,13
3996,ygritte, f,ygritte, He wasn't good to me the way you're good to me. He didn't do that thing you do with your tongue.,6,3,21
3997,ygritte, f,ygritte," 'Can we not talk about that here? I'm Jon Snow. I've killed dead men and Qhorin Halfhand, but I'm scared of naked girls.'",6,3,23
3998,ygritte, f,ygritte, You were trembling like a leaf.,6,3,6
3999,ygritte, f,ygritte," Only in the beginning. You're a proper lover, Jon Snow. And don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.",6,3,18
4000,ygritte, f,ygritte, Do you think I'm as dumb as all those girls in silk dresses you knew growing up? You're loyal and you're brave. You didn't stop being a crow the day you walked into Mance Rayder's tent.,6,3,36
4001,ygritte, f,ygritte," But I'm your woman now, Jon Snow. You're going to be loyal to your woman. The Night's Watch don't care if you live or die. Mance Rayder don't care if I live or die. We're just soldiers in their armies and there's plenty more to carry on if we go down.",6,3,51
4002,ygritte, f,ygritte, It's you and me that matters to me and you. Don't ever betray me.,6,3,14
4003,ygritte, f,ygritte, 'Cause I'll cut your pretty cock right off and wear it 'round my neck.,6,3,14
4004,ygritte, f,ygritte," You staring at my ass, Jon Snow?",6,3,7
4005,ygritte, f,ygritte, You all right?,6,3,3
4006,ygritte, f,ygritte, (screams),6,3,1
4007,ygritte, f,ygritte, (screams),6,3,1
4008,ygritte, f,ygritte, (screams),6,3,1
4009,ygritte, f,ygritte, (screams),6,3,1
4010,ygritte, f,ygritte, How far are we?,7,3,4
4011,ygritte, f,ygritte, You think? You don't know?,7,3,5
4012,ygritte, f,ygritte, You and your roads. Is that how you lot do your fighting?  You march down the road banging drums and waving banners?,7,3,22
4013,ygritte, f,ygritte, How do the men holding the banners fight?,7,3,8
4014,ygritte, f,ygritte, So what good are they?,7,3,5
4015,ygritte, f,ygritte, How?,7,3,1
4016,ygritte, f,ygritte," Oh, you mean right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot? You need help remembering that? When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black, we won't be banging on drums to let them know we're coming.",7,3,40
4017,ygritte, f,ygritte," You know nothing, Jon Snow.",7,3,5
4018,ygritte, f,ygritte,"  No, he didn't tell me anything. He barely talks.",7,3,9
4019,ygritte, f,ygritte," What, you're jealous?",7,3,3
4020,ygritte, f,ygritte, And you're one of my own? I've never heard a kind word from your mouth.,7,3,15
4021,ygritte, f,ygritte, (nods),7,3,1
4022,ygritte, f,ygritte,  Don't touch me.,7,3,3
4023,ygritte, f,ygritte, I'm not gonna scare it. I'm gonna kill it.,7,3,9
4024,ygritte, f,ygritte, (smiles),7,3,1
4025,ygritte, f,ygritte, Is that a palace?,7,3,4
4026,ygritte, f,ygritte, Windmill. Who built it?  Some king?,7,3,6
4027,ygritte, f,ygritte," They must have been great builders, stacking stones so high.",7,3,10
4028,ygritte, f,ygritte, 'I'm Jon Snow and I'm from Winterfell. My daddy was a fancy lord and I lived in a tower that touched the clouds.',7,3,23
4029,ygritte, f,ygritte, What's swooning?,7,3,2
4030,ygritte, f,ygritte, What's fainting?,7,3,2
4031,ygritte, f,ygritte, Why would a girl see blood and collapse?,7,3,8
4032,ygritte, f,ygritte," Well, girls see more blood than boys. Or do you like girls who swoon, Jon Snow? (gasps) Oh, a spider! Save me, Jon Snow.",7,3,24
4033,ygritte, f,ygritte, My dress is made of the purest silk from Tralalalaleeday.,7,3,10
4034,ygritte, f,ygritte, Would you?,7,3,2
4035,ygritte, f,ygritte," Well, you rip my pretty silk dress, I'll blacken your eye.",7,3,11
4036,ygritte, f,ygritte, Or maybe one day I'll take you there. After we've taken our land back.,7,3,14
4037,ygritte, f,ygritte, You know nothing--,7,3,3
4038,ygritte, f,ygritte, And how do you know that?,7,3,6
4039,ygritte, f,ygritte, Mance is different.,7,3,3
4040,ygritte, f,ygritte, You don't know that.,7,3,4
4041,ygritte, f,ygritte, All of us.,7,3,3
4042,ygritte, f,ygritte," You're mine as I'm yours. And if we die, we die. But first we'll live.",7,3,15
4043,ygritte, f,ygritte, Yes.,9,4,1
4044,ygritte, f,ygritte, I know you never fucked a bear. You know you never fucked a bear. Right now I don't wanna think about the bear you never fucked. Right now all I want to think about is each one of these arrows finding its way into a Crow's heart.,9,4,47
4045,ygritte, f,ygritte," Good. The longer we wait, the more arrows I'll have. When they came up here, to our land, and put up a big wall and said it was their's. Then they started hunting us down. But this time, we're the one's doing the hunting.",9,4,44
4046,ygritte, f,ygritte," Back in those villages I killed just as many of them as you did. More, I reckon.",9,4,17

4104,ygritte, f,ygritte," What, stones? Or bone?",7,2,4
4105,ygritte, f,ygritte," I heard they get all swollen and bruised if you don't use them. Of course, maybe that's just what the lads say when they want me feeling sorry for them. As if I'd feel sorry for them. Are there no girl crows?",7,2,42

4114,ygritte, f,ygritte," You think we're savages because we don't live in stone castles. We can't make steel as good as yours, it's true, but We're free. If someone tried to tell us we couldn't lie down as man and woman, we'd shove a spear up his arse. We don't go serving some shit king who's only king because his father was.",7,2,59
4115,ygritte, f,ygritte," We chose Mance Rayder to lead us. He was a crow, same as you, but he wanted to be free. You could be free, too. You don't need to live your whole life taking commands from old men. Wake up when you want to wake up. I could show you the streams to fish, the woods to hunt. Build yourself a cabin and find a woman to lie with in the night.",7,2,72

4283,gilly, f,gilly,  Steps.  That number was steps.,5,7,5
4284,gilly, f,gilly,  Are you sure you want to do this?  You always wanted to be a maester.,5,7,15
4285,gilly, f,gilly," When the time comes, you'll be down in the crypts.",2,8,10
4286,gilly, f,gilly, They're the safest place to be. Through that archway right over there.,2,8,12
4287,gilly, f,gilly," That's good to hear. I'm going to be in the crypt with my son, and I'd feel a lot better with you down there to protect us.",2,8,27
4288,gilly, f,gilly," I'm sure he knows how it happens, Sam. If it's a boy, we want to name him Jon.",4,8,18
4289,gilly, f,gilly, You all right?,3,6,3
4290,gilly, f,gilly, Did I ever tell you I used to think the sea was called the see because it was nothing but water as far as the eye could see?,3,6,28
4291,gilly, f,gilly," Sea, see. They’re spelled different, but they sound the same.",3,6,10
4292,gilly, f,gilly," It was before I learned how to read, obviously.",3,6,9
4293,gilly, f,gilly," Sam, are you going to be sick?",3,6,7
4294,gilly, f,gilly, Won’t be long. We’ll be in the south soon. I’m excited to see Oldtown. Captain says it’s the most beautiful city in Westeros. Are you going to vomit again?,3,6,29
4295,gilly, f,gilly, I stayed at Castle Black. There’s no women allowed there.,3,6,10
4296,gilly, f,gilly," I’ll stay in Oldtown, then.",3,6,5
4297,gilly, f,gilly," So if we’re not going to Oldtown, where are you taking me?",3,6,12
4298,gilly, f,gilly," “Wherever you go, I go, too.” That’s what you said.",3,6,10
4299,gilly, f,gilly, Us and everyone else in the world.,3,6,7
4300,gilly, f,gilly," I know that, Sam. And he does, too. You're the only one who ever has.",3,6,15
4301,gilly, f,gilly," If you think it’s for the best, we trust you.",3,6,10
4302,gilly, f,gilly, I’d never do that to the father of my son.,3,6,10
4303,gilly, f,gilly, It’s so green.,6,6,3
4304,gilly, f,gilly, You’re nervous. You’re a nervous talker.,6,6,6
4305,gilly, f,gilly, That’s not any better being a nervous mute.,6,6,8
4306,gilly, f,gilly, That Little Sam is your baby.,6,6,6
4307,gilly, f,gilly, What did you tell your family about me?,6,6,8
4308,gilly, f,gilly, Did you tell them how far north?,6,6,7
4309,gilly, f,gilly, You didn’t tell them where I’m really from? You didn’t tell them I’m a wildling?,6,6,15
4310,gilly, f,gilly, I think we’re here.,6,6,4
4311,gilly, f,gilly," I am happy to know you, Lady Tarly.",6,6,8
4312,gilly, f,gilly," Yes, of course.",6,6,3
4313,gilly, f,gilly, It’s hard to walk in this.,6,6,6
4314,gilly, f,gilly, He can wield a sword. He killed a Thenn. He killed a White Walker.,6,6,14
4315,gilly, f,gilly, I saw it with my own eyes on our way down to Castle Black. He drove a dagger into the walker’s heart. He risked his own life to save mine more than once. He’s a greater warrior than either of you will ever be.,6,6,44
4316,gilly, f,gilly, The Night’s Watch came to our keep.,6,6,7
4317,gilly, f,gilly, North of the Wall.,6,6,4
4318,gilly, f,gilly, I’m not angry at you. I’m angry that horrible people can treat good people that way and get away with it. When do you have to go?,6,6,27
4319,gilly, f,gilly," You’re not what he thinks you are, Sam. He doesn’t know what you are.",6,6,14
4320,gilly, f,gilly, Sam?,6,6,1
4321,gilly, f,gilly, What?,6,6,1
4322,gilly, f,gilly, I don’t have any things.,6,6,5
4323,gilly, f,gilly, What are you doing?,6,6,4
4324,gilly, f,gilly, What about your mother and sister?,6,6,6
4325,gilly, f,gilly, Your sister’s dress.,6,6,3
4326,gilly, f,gilly, Sam. That’s your father’s sword.,6,6,5
4327,gilly, f,gilly, Sam. Won’t he come for it?,6,6,6
4328,oberyn, m,oberyn, I like to move around.,8,4,5
4329,oberyn, m,oberyn, You learn this during your years in the fighting pits? I always drink before a fight.,8,4,16
4330,oberyn, m,oberyn, Today is not the day I die.,8,4,7
4331,oberyn, m,oberyn, I'm going to kill that.,8,4,5
4332,oberyn, m,oberyn, Size does not matter when you are flat on your back.,8,4,11
4333,oberyn, m,oberyn, Never.,8,4,1
4334,oberyn, m,oberyn, Have they told you who I am?,8,4,7
4335,oberyn, m,oberyn, I am the brother of Elia Martell. Do you know why I have come all the way to this stinking shit-pile of a city? For you.,8,4,26
4336,oberyn, m,oberyn, I'm going to hear you confess before you die. You raped my sister. You murdered her. You killed her children. Say it now and we can make this quick.,8,4,29
4337,oberyn, m,oberyn, Say it. You raped her. You murdered her. You killed her children.,8,4,12
4338,oberyn, m,oberyn, You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children!,8,4,10
4339,oberyn, m,oberyn, You raped her! You murdered her!,8,4,6
4340,oberyn, m,oberyn, You killed her children!,8,4,4
4341,oberyn, m,oberyn," Wait. Are you dying? No, no, no. You can't die yet. You haven't confessed. Say it. Say her name. Elia Martell. You raped her. You killed her children. Elia Martell. Who gave you the order? Who gave you the order?! Say her name! You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children. Say it. Say her name. Say it!",8,4,60
4342,oberyn, m,oberyn, Greedy.,3,4,1
4343,oberyn, m,oberyn, You're calling my beauty an acquired taste?,3,4,7
4344,oberyn, m,oberyn, Your loss.,3,4,2
4345,oberyn, m,oberyn, Does that surprise you?,3,4,4
4346,oberyn, m,oberyn," Then everyone is missing half the world's pleasure. The gods made that and it delights me. The gods made this and it delights me. When it comes to war, I fight for Dorne. When it comes to love, I don't choose sides.",3,4,42
4347,oberyn, m,oberyn," What are you, 25?",3,4,4
4348,oberyn, m,oberyn,"  (CHUCKLES) Someday, if you're lucky, you will wake up and realize you are old. That pretty ass of yours will sag. Your belly will grow soft and your back will ache in the night and gray hairs will sprout from your ears. No one will want you anymore. Make sure you fucked your fill before that day.",3,4,57
4349,oberyn, m,oberyn, They will all have to line up behind you.,3,4,9
4350,oberyn, m,oberyn, Lord Tywin.,3,4,2
4351,oberyn, m,oberyn, Would you like to sit?,3,4,5
4352,oberyn, m,oberyn, Some wine?,3,4,2
4353,oberyn, m,oberyn,  I'm sorry about your grandson.,3,4,5
4354,oberyn, m,oberyn, I don't believe that a child is responsible for the sins of his father. Or his grandfather. An awful way to die.,3,4,22
4355,oberyn, m,oberyn," Are you interrogating me, Lord Tywin?",3,4,6
4356,oberyn, m,oberyn, Some believe the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant. The king was poisoned.,3,4,20
4357,oberyn, m,oberyn, I did. This is why I know.,3,4,7
4358,oberyn, m,oberyn, Rather suspicious. Why haven't you thrown me in a dungeon?,3,4,10
4359,oberyn, m,oberyn, You think we conspired together?,3,4,5
4360,oberyn, m,oberyn, The death of my sister.,3,4,5
4361,oberyn, m,oberyn, She was raped and murdered by the Mountain. The Mountain follows your orders. Of course I blame you.,3,4,18
4362,oberyn, m,oberyn," You are unarmed and unguarded because you know me better than that. I am a man of reason. If I cut your throat today, I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow.",3,4,31
4363,oberyn, m,oberyn, So you deny involvement in Elia's murder?,3,4,7
4364,oberyn, m,oberyn, I would like to speak with the Mountain.,3,4,8
4365,oberyn, m,oberyn, He might not enjoy it as much as he thinks he would.,3,4,12
4366,oberyn, m,oberyn, But you want something in return.,3,4,6
4367,oberyn, m,oberyn, Why?,3,4,1
4368,oberyn, m,oberyn," Well, you made the Tyrell girl a queen. Asking me to judge at your son's trial isn't quite as tempting.",3,4,20
4369,oberyn, m,oberyn," I never realized you had such respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.",3,4,11
4370,oberyn, m,oberyn, You're saying you need us? That must be hard for you to admit.,3,4,13
4371,oberyn, m,oberyn, Hello.,2,4,1
4372,oberyn, m,oberyn, Not you.,2,4,2
4373,oberyn, m,oberyn, Your Grace. Lord Tywin.,2,4,4
4374,oberyn, m,oberyn," I don't believe you have met Ellaria. This is the Lord Hand Tywin Lannister and Cersei Lannister the Queen Regent. I suppose it is former Queen Regent now. Lord Hand and Lady Cersei, Ellaria Sand.",2,4,35
4375,oberyn, m,oberyn," Bastards are born of passion, aren't they? We don't despise them in Dorne.",2,4,13
4376,oberyn, m,oberyn," I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei, giving up your regal responsibilities. Wearing the crown for so many years must have left your neck a bit crooked.",2,4,28
4377,oberyn, m,oberyn, They call it the rich man's disease. A wonder you don't have it.,2,4,13
4378,oberyn, m,oberyn," People everywhere have their differences. In some places the highborn frown upon those of low birth. In other places the rape and murder of women and children is considered distasteful. What a fortunate thing for you, former Queen Regent, that your daughter Myrcella has been sent to live in the latter sort of place.",2,4,54
4379,oberyn, m,oberyn, Look at this one. How lovely is she?,1,4,8
4380,oberyn, m,oberyn, They like them pale in the capital. Shows they don't work the fields.,1,4,13
4381,oberyn, m,oberyn, You like?,1,4,2
4382,oberyn, m,oberyn," You're a bit of mischief, aren't you?",1,4,7
4383,oberyn, m,oberyn," I think she likes you. ELLARIA"" She has good taste.",1,4,10
4384,oberyn, m,oberyn," You're not timid, are you?",1,4,5
4385,oberyn, m,oberyn,  Do you like women?,1,4,4
4386,oberyn, m,oberyn,  The two girls can leave.,1,4,5
4387,oberyn, m,oberyn,  You stay.,1,4,2
4388,oberyn, m,oberyn,  Everyone who works for Littlefinger is an offer. Take off your clothes. We'll be here a while.,1,4,17
4389,oberyn, m,oberyn,"  I am a prince, boy. Have you ever been with a prince?",1,4,12
4390,oberyn, m,oberyn,  Take off your clothes.,1,4,4
4391,oberyn, m,oberyn, My way  .,1,4,3
4392,oberyn, m,oberyn, Forgive me for staring. I don't see many Lannisters where I'm from.,1,4,12
4393,oberyn, m,oberyn, We don't like the smell. (Laughs),1,4,6
4394,oberyn, m,oberyn, Do you know why all the world hates a Lannister?,1,4,10
4395,oberyn, m,oberyn, You think your gold and your lions and your gold lions make you better than everyone. May I tell you a secret? You're not a golden lion. You're just a pink little man who is far too slow on the draw.,1,4,41
4396,oberyn, m,oberyn," Longsword is a bad option in close quarters. When I pull my blade, your friend starts bleeding. Quite a lot, I'm afraid. So many veins in the wrist.",1,4,28
4397,oberyn, m,oberyn," He'll live if you get him help straightaway. So, decisions.",1,4,10
4398,oberyn, m,oberyn," Apologies, my love.",1,4,3
4399,oberyn, m,oberyn," Ellaria Sand, my paramour. The king's own Uncle Imp. Tyrion, son of Tywin Lannister.",1,4,14
4400,oberyn, m,oberyn, What are you? His hired killer?,1,4,6
4401,oberyn, m,oberyn, How did that come to pass?,1,4,6
4402,oberyn, m,oberyn," We'll need a few more girls. Girls, yes?",1,4,8
4403,oberyn, m,oberyn, Seems I visited the Lannister brothel by mistake.,1,4,8
4404,oberyn, m,oberyn, Even Dornishmen.,1,4,2
4405,oberyn, m,oberyn, Let us speak truth here. Joffrey is insulted. I am only the second son after all.,1,4,16
4406,oberyn, m,oberyn, (Chuckles),1,4,1
4407,oberyn, m,oberyn, I was invited to the royal wedding.,1,4,7
4408,oberyn, m,oberyn," The last time I was in the capital was many years ago. Another wedding. My sister Elia and Rhaegar Targaryen, the Last Dragon. My sister loved him. She bore his children. Swaddled them, rocked them, fed them at her own breast. Elia wouldn't let the wet nurse touch them. And beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen left her for another woman. That started a war and the war ended right here when your father's army took the city...",1,4,76
4409,oberyn, m,oberyn," And butchered those children. My nephew and niece. Carved them up and wrapped them in Lannister cloaks. And my sister, you know what they did to her?",1,4,27
4410,oberyn, m,oberyn, I'm asking you a question.,1,4,5
4411,oberyn, m,oberyn, (Chuckles) So have I. The one I keep hearing is that Gregor Clegane the Mountain raped Elia and split her in half with his great sword.,1,4,26
4412,oberyn, m,oberyn," If the Mountain killed my sister, your father gave the order. Tell your father I'm here. And tell him the Lannisters aren't the only ones who pay their debts.",1,4,29
4413,oberyn, m,oberyn, Your Grace.,5,4,2
4414,oberyn, m,oberyn,"  A poem, actually.",5,4,3
4415,oberyn, m,oberyn,  I couldn't very well refuse a royal escort.,5,4,8
4416,oberyn, m,oberyn, Not a very good one.,5,4,5
4417,oberyn, m,oberyn, For one of my daughters.,5,4,5
4418,oberyn, m,oberyn, Eight.,5,4,1
4419,oberyn, m,oberyn,  The fifth is difficult. I named her after my sister Elia.,5,4,11
4420,oberyn, m,oberyn,"  Yes. But I can't say it without turning sad. And after I turn sad, I grow angry.",5,4,17
4421,oberyn, m,oberyn, Which joke is that?,5,4,4
4422,oberyn, m,oberyn, We can avenge them.,5,4,4
4423,oberyn, m,oberyn, You really believe Tyrion murdered your son?,5,4,7
4424,oberyn, m,oberyn, We will have a trial and we will learn the truth.,5,4,11
4425,oberyn, m,oberyn," The last time I saw her, she was swimming with two of my girls in the Water Gardens. Laughing in the sun.",5,4,22
4426,oberyn, m,oberyn, You have my word. We don't hurt little girls in Dorne.,5,4,11
4427,oberyn, m,oberyn, Anything at all.,5,4,3
4428,oberyn, m,oberyn, I will have it sailed down to Sunspear for her.,5,4,10
4429,oberyn, m,oberyn," These meetings aren't always going to be this early, are they? I was up late last night. So, does this mean I am a master of something now? Coins, ships?",6,4,30
4430,oberyn, m,oberyn, Lord Varys is right. I have been to Essos and seen the Unsullied firsthand. They are very impressive on the battlefield. Less so in the bedroom.,6,4,26
4431,oberyn, m,oberyn, Lord Varys...,6,4,2
4432,oberyn, m,oberyn, And yet everyone does.,6,4,4
4433,oberyn, m,oberyn, Five years.,6,4,2
4434,oberyn, m,oberyn, 'Tis a big and beautiful world. Most of us live and die in the same corner where we were born and never get to see any of it. I don't want to be most of us.,6,4,36
4435,oberyn, m,oberyn, You are from Essos. Where? Lys?,6,4,6
4436,oberyn, m,oberyn, I have an ear for that as well. How did you get here?,6,4,13
4437,oberyn, m,oberyn, One you don't like telling people.,6,4,6
4438,oberyn, m,oberyn," My paramour Ellaria, she would find you very interesting. You should come to the brothel and meet her. We brought our own wine, not the swill they serve here. We have some lovely boys on retainer, but...",6,4,37
4439,oberyn, m,oberyn, You did like boys before?,6,4,5
4440,oberyn, m,oberyn,  Really? Girls? Hmm. I hope you won't be offended when I say I never would have guessed.,6,4,17
4441,oberyn, m,oberyn,  What then?,6,4,2
4442,oberyn, m,oberyn, Everybody is interested in something.,6,4,5
4443,oberyn, m,oberyn, Such as?,6,4,2
4444,oberyn, m,oberyn," I think you have made your point, Grand Maester. You have a lot of poison in your store.",6,4,18
4445,oberyn, m,oberyn," Tyrion said, ""And you will know the debt is paid."" What debt?",6,4,12
4446,oberyn, m,oberyn, How could you possibly know all this? Why would he reveal such plans to his wife's maid?,6,4,17
4447,oberyn, m,oberyn, And did you?,6,4,3
4448,oberyn, m,oberyn, Fuck him like it was his last night in this world.,6,4,11
4449,oberyn, m,oberyn, I did spend some time with an absolutely stunning blonde the other day.,7,4,13
4450,oberyn, m,oberyn, Your sister.,7,4,2
4451,oberyn, m,oberyn,  Cersei approached me. We spoke a great deal about her daughter. How worried your sister is about her. She was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you. I think she may have even believed it herself.,7,4,43
4452,oberyn, m,oberyn, It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions. It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters. She desperately wants to see you killed.,7,4,31
4453,oberyn, m,oberyn," Yes, I know. We met, you and I. Many years ago.",7,4,11
4454,oberyn, m,oberyn," Unlikely. You had just been born. Our father brought me and my sister Elia with him on a visit to Casterly Rock. My first time away from Dorne. I didn't like anything about the Rock. Not the food, not the weather, your accents. Nothing. But the biggest disappointment... you.",7,4,49
4455,oberyn, m,oberyn," The whole way from Dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister. A head twice the size of his body, a tail between his legs, claws, one red eye, the privates of both a girl and a boy.",7,4,45
4456,oberyn, m,oberyn," When we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us. Every day we would ask. Every day she would say, ""Soon."" Then she and your brother took us to your nursery and... she unveiled the freak. Your head was a bit large. Your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw. No red eye. No tail between your legs. Just a tiny pink cock. We didn't try to hide our disappointment. ""That's not a monster,"" I told Cersei. ""That's just a baby."" And she said, ""He killed my mother."" And she pinched your little cock so hard, I thought she might pull it off. Until your brother made her stop. ""It doesn't matter,"" she told us. ""Everyone says he will die soon. I hope they are right. He should not have lived this long.""",7,4,139
4457,oberyn, m,oberyn, And what about what I want? Justice for my sister and her children.,7,4,13
4458,oberyn, m,oberyn, I disagree.,7,4,2
4459,oberyn, m,oberyn," I've come to the perfect place. I want to bring those who have wronged me to justice. And all those who have wronged me are right here. I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane, who killed my sister's children and then raped her with their blood still on his hands before killing her, too. I will be your champion.",7,4,59
4460,the, m,the, Remember what happens to children who run.  I'm your father and I'll do the talking.,9,3,15
4461,the, m,the, Need a hand?,9,3,3
4462,the, m,the, Dead rats don't squeak.,9,3,4
4463,the, m,the, More than anyone you know.,9,3,5
4464,the, m,the, That so?,9,3,2
4465,the, m,the, That him?,9,3,2
4466,the, m,the, Good.,9,3,1
4467,the, m,the, You're very kind.  Someday it'll get you killed.,9,3,8
4468,the, m,the, Best part of the animal.,9,3,5
4469,the, m,the," Don’t worry, they’re still there.",9,3,5
4470,the, m,the, You check every five minutes like you’re afraid they’re gonna move.,9,3,11
4471,the, m,the," Of course you are.  You’re almost there and you’re afraid you won’t make it.  The closer you get, the worse the fear gets.  No point in trying to hide behind that face.  I know fear when I see it.  Seen it a lot.",9,3,43
4472,the, m,the, That give you some ideas?,9,3,5
4473,the, m,the, Go ahead then.  You might get away.  Might even make it there on your own.  They’re just over the river.  The closest you’ve been to family since Ilyn Payne snipped your daddy’s neck.,9,3,33
4474,the, m,the," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.",9,3,4
4475,the, m,the, Got salt pork for the feast.,9,3,6
4476,the, m,the, It doesn’t sound like it’s over.,9,3,6
4477,the, m,the," Got pig’s feet, too [ARYA looks up].",9,3,7
4478,the, m,the, It’s too late.,9,3,3

4481,the, m,the," Rough night, Imp?",1,1,3
4482,the, m,the, I didn’t pick you for a hunter.,1,1,7
4483,the, m,the, It’s not hunting if you pay for it.,1,1,8
4484,jaime, m,jaime, Cersei.,10,3,1
4485,jaime, m,jaime,"  I hope you're pleased. If you had armed me, they never would have taken us.",3,3,15
4486,jaime, m,jaime, I was in chains if you recall. Our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands weren't bound.,3,3,20
4487,jaime, m,jaime, I've been sitting in a muddy pen wrapped in chains for the past year.,3,3,14
4488,jaime, m,jaime, You were not beating me.,3,3,5
4489,jaime, m,jaime," When we make camp tonight, you'll be raped. More than once. None of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman. You'd be wise not to resist.",3,3,27
4490,jaime, m,jaime, They'll knock your teeth out.,3,3,5
4491,jaime, m,jaime," No, I don't think you care about your teeth. If you fight them, they will kill you. Do you understand? I'm the prisoner of value, not you. Let them have what they want. What does it matter?",3,3,37
4492,jaime, m,jaime, Close your eyes. Pretend they're Renly.,3,3,6
4493,jaime, m,jaime,"  If I was a woman, I'd make them kill me. But I'm not, thank the gods.",3,3,16
4494,jaime, m,jaime," You know who she is, don't you?",3,3,7
4495,jaime, m,jaime, She's Brienne of Tarth. Her father is Lord Selwyn Tarth. Heard of Tarth?,3,3,13
4496,jaime, m,jaime, They call it the Sapphire Isle. Do you know why? Every sapphire in Westeros was mined on Tarth. Sapphires are gemstones. The blue ones.,3,3,24
4497,jaime, m,jaime," Lord Selwyn would pay his daughter's weight in sapphires if she's returned to him. But only if she's alive, her honor unbesmirched.",3,3,22
4498,jaime, m,jaime, Not defiled.,3,3,2
4499,jaime, m,jaime," I hated to read as a child, but my father forced me to study the books every morning before I could practice with sword or horse. Two hours every day holed up in the maester's chambers. I learned a lot of fancy words.",3,3,43
4500,jaime, m,jaime, Fighting bravely for a losing cause is admirable. Fighting for a winning cause is far more rewarding.,3,3,17
4501,jaime, m,jaime," Now that we're speaking together man to man, I wonder if you need to keep me chained to this tree. I'm not asking to be freed from my constraints, but if I could sleep lying down, my back would thank you for it. I'm not as young and resilient as I was once.",3,3,53
4502,jaime, m,jaime," I'm famished, actually.",3,3,3
4503,jaime, m,jaime," Well, I do like partridge.",3,3,5
4504,jaime, m,jaime,  My father--,3,3,2
4505,jaime, m,jaime,  Don't.,3,3,1
4506,jaime, m,jaime, Do you know how long it's going to take us to get to King's Landing walking through fields and forests?,2,3,20
4507,jaime, m,jaime, So how shall we pass the time?,2,3,7
4508,jaime, m,jaime, It's going to be a very dull walk.,2,3,8
4509,jaime, m,jaime," You know, it doesn't matter how loyal a servant you are, no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute. Trust me on this. People have been serving me since I was born. You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life? A week's journey with you and she'll order you to fall on your sword.",2,3,68
4510,jaime, m,jaime, All the good it's done her.,2,3,6
4511,jaime, m,jaime, How did you come into Lady Stark's service? There's something we can talk about.,2,3,14
4512,jaime, m,jaime, It had to be recently. You weren't with her at Winterfell.,2,3,11
4513,jaime, m,jaime, Because I visited Winterfell. I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways.,2,3,15
4514,jaime, m,jaime, Were you pledged to Stannis?,2,3,5
4515,jaime, m,jaime," Ah, Renly. Really? He wasn't fit to rule over anything more important than a 12-course meal.",2,3,16
4516,jaime, m,jaime," Why? I lived with him at court since he was a boy, don't forget. Could hardly escape the little tulip. Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks. I knew him far better than you.",2,3,35
4517,jaime, m,jaime, Sounds like you quite fancied him.,2,3,6
4518,jaime, m,jaime," Oh, gods, you did.",2,3,4
4519,jaime, m,jaime," Did you ever tell him? No, of course not. You weren't Renly's type, I'm afraid.",2,3,15
4520,jaime, m,jaime, He preferred curly-haired little girls like Loras Tyrell. You're far too much man for him.,2,3,15
4521,jaime, m,jaime, Unless they're about me. It's all true about Renly. His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court. It's a shame the throne isn't made out of cocks. They'd have never got him off it.,2,3,35
4522,jaime, m,jaime," I don't blame him. And I don't blame you, either. We don't get to choose who we love.",2,3,18
4523,jaime, m,jaime," No, you really can't.",2,3,4
4524,jaime, m,jaime, He knows who I am.,2,3,5
4525,jaime, m,jaime, Maybe you're right.  But what if you're not? What if he tells someone?,2,3,13
4526,jaime, m,jaime, More innocent than Lady Stark's daughters?,2,3,6
4527,jaime, m,jaime,  It's a tough decision-take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water.,2,3,15
4528,jaime, m,jaime," Anyone can see us on the bridge, but cross by water and the current could take us or I could escape down the river.",2,3,24
4529,jaime, m,jaime, It's wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas. Which will she choose?,2,3,13
4530,jaime, m,jaime, Gambler at heart. Wouldn't have guessed.,2,3,6
4531,jaime, m,jaime, I need to rest.,2,3,4
4532,jaime, m,jaime," I have these, you know, on your feet when you walk too far. What do you call them?",2,3,18
4533,jaime, m,jaime," Corns. I never used to get corns. Of course I used to ride everywhere, not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same shit boots for over a year.",2,3,31
4534,jaime, m,jaime, This heel is ruined. There's no way-,2,3,7
4535,jaime, m,jaime,  I never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords.,2,3,13
4536,jaime, m,jaime, Ooh. You move well for a great beast of a woman.,2,3,11
4537,jaime, m,jaime, You shouldn't grimace before you lunge. It gives away the game.,2,3,11
4538,jaime, m,jaime," Bit of a quandary for you. If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark. But if you don't kill me, I'm going to kill you.",2,3,25
4539,jaime, m,jaime," You're good. Graceless, but good.",2,3,5
4540,jaime, m,jaime," See? If you were willing to hurt me, you might have had me there.",2,3,14
4541,jaime, m,jaime, We enjoy a good fight. Gets our juices flowing. The Flayed Man of House Bolton. A bit gruesome for my taste.,2,3,21
4542,jaime, m,jaime, Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want.,2,3,12
4543,jaime, m,jaime, Lord Bolton.,5,3,2
4544,jaime, m,jaime, Will I die?,5,3,3
4545,jaime, m,jaime, Then you'll die. You're no maester. Where's your chain?,5,3,9
4546,jaime, m,jaime, I don't need my right hand to kill you.,5,3,9
4547,jaime, m,jaime, Mmm.,5,3,1
4548,jaime, m,jaime, No milk of the poppy.,5,3,5
4549,jaime, m,jaime, I'll scream.,5,3,2
4550,jaime, m,jaime, I'll scream loudly.,5,3,3
4551,jaime, m,jaime, Not so hard. You'll scrub the skin off.,5,3,8
4552,jaime, m,jaime, I need a bath. Help me out of these rags.,5,3,10
4553,jaime, m,jaime, Now get out.,5,3,3
4554,jaime, m,jaime," This one suits me fine. Don't worry. I'm not interested. If I faint, pull me out. I don't intend to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub.",5,3,29
4555,jaime, m,jaime," You swore a solemn vow, remember? You're supposed to get me to King's Landing in one piece. Not going so well, is it? No wonder Renly died with you guarding him.",5,3,31
4556,jaime, m,jaime, That was unworthy. Forgive me. You protected me better than most--,5,3,11
4557,jaime, m,jaime, I'm apologizing. I'm sick of fighting. Let's call a truce.,5,3,10
4558,jaime, m,jaime, I trust you.,5,3,3
4559,jaime, m,jaime, There it is. There's the look. I've seen it for 17 years on face after face. You all despise me. Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. A man without honor. You've heard of wildfire?,5,3,30
4560,jaime, m,jaime, Stark? You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me. By what right does the wolf judge the lion? By what right?,5,3,35
4561,jaime, m,jaime, Jaime. My name is Jaime.,5,3,5
4562,jaime, m,jaime," (desperately) Water. Water. Please, water. Wa-water. Water, please. Please. Please.",4,3,10
4563,jaime, m,jaime," If I die, you won't be getting--",4,3,7
4564,jaime, m,jaime, I'm dying.,4,3,2
4565,jaime, m,jaime, I don't care about revenge.,4,3,5
4566,jaime, m,jaime, My sword hand. I was that hand.,4,3,7
4567,jaime, m,jaime," You should. But instead, you're sitting here watching me fail at dinner. Why might that be?",6,3,16
4568,jaime, m,jaime, We both know who would pay the most. Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution.,6,3,32
4569,jaime, m,jaime," It would be, if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it.",6,3,15
4570,jaime, m,jaime, He'll make time for you.,6,3,5
4571,jaime, m,jaime, Shall we drink on it?,6,3,5
4572,jaime, m,jaime, You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people?,6,3,10
4573,jaime, m,jaime," Very well. My lady, may our journey continue without further incident.",6,3,11
4574,jaime, m,jaime, I'm afraid I must insist.,6,3,5
4575,jaime, m,jaime, Tomorrow.,7,3,1
4576,jaime, m,jaime,  Lord Bolton's traveling tomorrow as well. He's going to the Twins for Edmure Tully's wedding. You're to remain here.,7,3,19
4577,jaime, m,jaime,  I owe you a debt.,7,3,5
4578,jaime, m,jaime, (nods) I will return the Stark girls to their mother. I swear it.,7,3,13
4579,jaime, m,jaime, (nods),7,3,1
4580,jaime, m,jaime, (nods)  Tell Robb Stark I'm sorry I couldn't make his uncle's wedding. The Lannisters send their regards.,7,3,17
4581,jaime, m,jaime,  What's the purpose of an arm with no hand?,7,3,9
4582,jaime, m,jaime," Yes, we've stymied the corruption. You're a learned man.",7,3,9
4583,jaime, m,jaime, You did well sewing up this mess. You're far better at this sort of work than Grand Maester Pycelle.,7,3,19
4584,jaime, m,jaime, So why did the Citadel take your chain? Did you fondle one boy too many?,7,3,15
4585,jaime, m,jaime, What is?,7,3,2
4586,jaime, m,jaime, You performed experiments on living men.,7,3,6
4587,jaime, m,jaime, With their permission?,7,3,3
4588,jaime, m,jaime," Dying paupers, I assume. Men with no families to complain. You found them moaning in the poorhouse and had them carted back to your garret and opened up their bellies to see what was inside.",7,3,35
4589,jaime, m,jaime,  I don't know.,7,3,3
4590,jaime, m,jaime, (shakes his head),7,3,3
4591,jaime, m,jaime, Countless has a nice ring to it.,7,3,7
4592,jaime, m,jaime, A fair offer.,7,3,3
4593,jaime, m,jaime, Why not?,7,3,2
4594,jaime, m,jaime, (sighs),7,3,1
4595,jaime, m,jaime, They'd be fools to kill her.,7,3,6
4596,jaime, m,jaime, We have to return to Harrenhal.,7,3,6
4597,jaime, m,jaime,  I've left something behind.,7,3,4
4598,jaime, m,jaime, And what are those orders?,7,3,5
4599,jaime, m,jaime, You think you'll get a reward.,7,3,6
4600,jaime, m,jaime," You think you're getting a reward. Let me explain something to you. When my father sees me, the first thing he's going to ask is what happened to my hand. And I'm going to tell him this man chopped it off.",7,3,41
4601,jaime, m,jaime, Or I could tell him this man saved my life. We return to Harrenhal now.,7,3,15
4602,jaime, m,jaime, Whoa.,7,3,1
4603,jaime, m,jaime, Be quiet.,7,3,2
4604,jaime, m,jaime, A wooden sword?,7,3,3
4605,jaime, m,jaime, You gave her a wooden sword.,7,3,6
4606,jaime, m,jaime," I'll pay her bloody ransom. Gold, sapphires, whatever you want. Just get her out of there.",7,3,16
4607,jaime, m,jaime, Get behind me.,7,3,3
4608,jaime, m,jaime, Pull her up.,7,3,3
4609,jaime, m,jaime, We're taking her to King's Landing. Unless you kill me.,7,3,10
4610,jaime, m,jaime, What do you think is more important to Lord Bolton?  Getting his pet rat a reward or ensuring Tywin Lannister gets his son back alive?,7,3,25
4611,jaime, m,jaime,"  Well, we must be on our way. Sorry about the sapphires.",7,3,11
4612,jaime, m,jaime, Soon.,8,4,1
4613,jaime, m,jaime, I've never seen him fight.,8,4,5
4614,jaime, m,jaime, Oberyn believes in himself.,8,4,4
4615,jaime, m,jaime, Beheading.,8,4,1
4616,jaime, m,jaime, Cousins.,8,4,1
4617,jaime, m,jaime, Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him on his head. Left him simple.,8,4,11
4618,jaime, m,jaime, Nothing made you happier. You'd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted.,8,4,19
4619,jaime, m,jaime," The joke wore thin, though.",8,4,5
4620,jaime, m,jaime, I had other interests.,8,4,4
4621,jaime, m,jaime, Why?,8,4,1
4622,jaime, m,jaime, Volarik. Tried to touch me once.,8,4,6
4623,jaime, m,jaime," Every day around the world, men, women, and children are murdered by the score. Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?",8,4,24
4624,jaime, m,jaime, He was twice your size.,8,4,5
4625,jaime, m,jaime, I don't know.,8,4,3
4626,jaime, m,jaime, Good luck today.,8,4,3
4627,jaime, m,jaime," You won. One fewer brother. Must be proud of yourself. There's really nothing you wouldn't do, is there?",10,4,18
4628,jaime, m,jaime, Tyrion is your family.,10,4,4
4629,jaime, m,jaime, You don't get to choose.,10,4,5
4630,jaime, m,jaime, Are you really mad enough to blame him for that? He didn't decide to kill her. He was an infant.,10,4,20
4631,jaime, m,jaime," The things I did to get back to you, to endure all that, only to find you-",10,4,17
4632,jaime, m,jaime, Those are words.,10,4,3
4633,jaime, m,jaime, Told him what?,10,4,3
4634,jaime, m,jaime, You told him?,10,4,3
4635,jaime, m,jaime, You think he'll just accept that?,10,4,6
4636,jaime, m,jaime, What did you say?,10,4,4
4637,jaime, m,jaime, Someone will walk in.,10,4,4
4638,jaime, m,jaime, Is that any way to speak about our mother?,10,4,9
4639,jaime, m,jaime, What do you think I’m doing? The galley’s waiting in the bay bound for the Free Cities.,10,4,17
4640,jaime, m,jaime, Varys.,10,4,1
4641,jaime, m,jaime, You have more friends than you thought.,10,4,7
4642,jaime, m,jaime," There’s a locked door at the top of the stairs. Knock on it twice, and then twice again. Varys will open.",10,4,21
4643,jaime, m,jaime," Farewell, little brother.",10,4,3
4644,jaime, m,jaime, Quickly now.,10,4,2
4645,jaime, m,jaime, How are you?,3,4,3
4646,jaime, m,jaime,You are. You will be. I'll see to that.,3,4,9
4647,jaime, m,jaime, Please give the queen a moment alone with her son.,3,4,10
4648,jaime, m,jaime, I don't know what I saw.,3,4,6
4649,jaime, m,jaime, Tyrion's my brother. Our brother. There'll be a trial. We'll get to the truth of what happened.,3,4,17
4650,jaime, m,jaime, You're a hateful woman. Why have the gods made me love a hateful woman?,3,4,14
4651,jaime, m,jaime, No.,3,4,1
4652,jaime, m,jaime, (GRUNTS),3,4,1
4653,jaime, m,jaime,  I don't care.,3,4,3
4654,jaime, m,jaime, I don't care.,3,4,3
4655,jaime, m,jaime, I don't care.,3,4,3
4656,jaime, m,jaime, Gilded steel.,2,4,2
4657,jaime, m,jaime, I'm not hungry.,2,4,3
4658,jaime, m,jaime,  Oh!,2,4,1
4659,jaime, m,jaime," No, I'll do it. Leave us.",2,4,6
4660,jaime, m,jaime, I can't fight anymore.,2,4,4
4661,jaime, m,jaime," I can hold a sword, but all my instincts are wrong. How can I protect the king when I can hardly wipe my own ass?",2,4,25
4662,jaime, m,jaime, I'm not Father. I'm the Kingslayer. When people find out I can't slay a pigeon...,2,4,15
4663,jaime, m,jaime," With whom? You? Men talk. Soon as someone discovers I can't fight, he'll tell everyone.",2,4,15
4664,jaime, m,jaime, My brother tells me you can keep your mouth shut. Unusual talent for a sellsword.,2,4,15
4665,jaime, m,jaime, Is this place safe?,2,4,4
4666,jaime, m,jaime, Uh-huh.,2,4,1
4667,jaime, m,jaime, I haven't used a sparring sword since I was nine.,2,4,10
4668,jaime, m,jaime," Ah! Bold warrior you are, attacking a man when his guard's down.",2,4,12
4669,jaime, m,jaime," Come on, then.",2,4,3
4670,jaime, m,jaime," Ser Loras, it's quite all right. Your sister looks very beautiful.",2,4,11
4671,jaime, m,jaime," So, looking forward to your wedding?",2,4,6
4672,jaime, m,jaime, Our fathers are both rather keen on the prospect.,2,4,9
4673,jaime, m,jaime," Perhaps they should get married. If you were to marry Cersei, she'd murder you in your sleep. If you somehow managed to put a child in her first, she'd murder him, too, long before he drew his first breath. Luckily for you, none of this will happen because you'll never marry her.",2,4,52
4674,jaime, m,jaime, Move away!,2,4,2
4675,jaime, m,jaime, Joffrey! Joffrey!,2,4,2
4676,jaime, m,jaime, Magnificent.,1,4,1
4677,jaime, m,jaime, Looks fresh-forged.,1,4,2
4678,jaime, m,jaime, No one's made a Valyrian steel sword since the Doom of Valyria.,1,4,12
4679,jaime, m,jaime, Where did you get this much Valyrian steel?,1,4,8
4680,jaime, m,jaime, You've wanted one of these in the family for a long time.,1,4,12
4681,jaime, m,jaime, Two?,1,4,1
4682,jaime, m,jaime," Well, thank you. It's glorious.",1,4,5
4683,jaime, m,jaime, Any decent swordsman knows how to use both hands.,1,4,9
4684,jaime, m,jaime," No. But as long as I'm better than everyone else, I suppose it doesn't matter.",1,4,15
4685,jaime, m,jaime, Where's that written? I can and I will. The Kingsguard oath is for life.,1,4,14
4686,jaime, m,jaime, How many people in this city alone would love to see his head on a pike?,1,4,16
4687,jaime, m,jaime, Home?,1,4,1
4688,jaime, m,jaime,You are the Lord of Casterly Rock.,1,4,7
4689,jaime, m,jaime, You know what they call me? Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. Man without honor. Now you want me to break another sacred vow.,1,4,20
4690,jaime, m,jaime, No.,1,4,1
4691,jaime, m,jaime, No.,1,4,1
4692,jaime, m,jaime, There's my answer.,1,4,3
4693,jaime, m,jaime," My bloody honor is beyond repair, but my answer is still no. I don't want Casterly Rock. I don't want a wife. I don't want children.",1,4,26
4694,jaime, m,jaime, Supper would be nice.,1,4,4
4695,jaime, m,jaime, I suppose you want the sword back.,1,4,7
4696,jaime, m,jaime, (Groans),1,4,1
4697,jaime, m,jaime," You like it so much, you're welcome to chop off your own hand and take it.",1,4,16
4698,jaime, m,jaime, Days?,1,4,1
4699,jaime, m,jaime, Uh... a hook would be more practical.,1,4,7
4700,jaime, m,jaime, Odd little man.,1,4,3
4701,jaime, m,jaime, What symptoms?,1,4,2
4702,jaime, m,jaime, You let him touch you?,1,4,5
4703,jaime, m,jaime, I'm surprised. You never let Pycelle near you.,1,4,8
4704,jaime, m,jaime, I'm not sure I've ever smelled a dead cat.,1,4,9
4705,jaime, m,jaime, You drink more than you used to.,1,4,7
4706,jaime, m,jaime, Why?,1,4,1
4707,jaime, m,jaime, It must have been traumatic for you.,1,4,7
4708,jaime, m,jaime, A rather short siege.,1,4,4
4709,jaime, m,jaime, Father disowned me today.,1,4,4
4710,jaime, m,jaime, You're forgetting Tyrion.,1,4,3
4711,jaime, m,jaime, Staying in the Kingsguard means I live right here in the Red Keep with you.,1,4,15
4712,jaime, m,jaime,  I want... Not now? When? I've been back for weeks.,1,4,10
4713,jaime, m,jaime, Something's changed.,1,4,2
4714,jaime, m,jaime, What do you want me to apologize for?,1,4,8
4715,jaime, m,jaime, You think I wanted to be taken prisoner?,1,4,8
4716,jaime, m,jaime," Every day I was a prisoner, I plotted my escape. Every day. I murdered people so I could be here with you.",1,4,22
4717,jaime, m,jaime,  I... What are you saying?,1,4,5
4718,jaime, m,jaime, Go away.,1,4,2
4719,jaime, m,jaime," All the Kingsguard will be on duty, of course. Ser Boros will be stationed here. Ser Preston will be stationed here beside the primary entertainment. Your Grace?",1,4,27
4720,jaime, m,jaime, Ser Meryn will guard Lady Margaery and Tommen.,1,4,8
4721,jaime, m,jaime," And I thank you for it, Ser Meryn. All very good. I don't expect any trouble.",1,4,16
4722,jaime, m,jaime," Margaery Tyrell, I've heard.",1,4,4
4723,jaime, m,jaime, The war's not won. Not while Stannis lives.,1,4,8
4724,jaime, m,jaime," My apologies, Your Grace. I was rather busy.",1,4,8
4725,jaime, m,jaime," So this is the famous ""Book of Brothers""? All the great deeds of all the great Kingsguard. Ser Arthur Dayne. The Sword of the Morning. (Chuckles) Led the attack on the Kingswood Brotherhood. Defeated the Smiling Knight in single combat. Ser Duncan the Tall. (Laughs) Four pages for Ser Duncan. He must have been quite a man.",1,4,57
4726,jaime, m,jaime, So they say.,1,4,3
4727,jaime, m,jaime,  There's still time.,1,4,3
4728,jaime, m,jaime," I use my left hand now, Your Grace. Makes for more of a contest.",1,4,14
4729,jaime, m,jaime," Yes, there she is.",1,4,4
4730,jaime, m,jaime, To return the Stark girls to their mother who is now dead.,1,4,12
4731,jaime, m,jaime," Well, Arya Stark hasn't been seen since her father was killed. Where do you think she is? My money's on dead. There's a certain safety in death, wouldn't you say? And Sansa Stark is now Sansa Lannister. Bit of a complication.",1,4,41
4732,jaime, m,jaime, What do you want me to do? Kidnap my sister-in-law? And take her where? Where would she be safer than here?,1,4,21
4733,jaime, m,jaime," Are you sure we're not related? Ever since I've returned, every Lannister I've seen has been a miserable pain in my ass. Maybe you're a Lannister, too. You've got the hair for it if not the looks.",1,4,37
4734,jaime, m,jaime, What the hell was that?,4,4,5
4735,jaime, m,jaime," You're a rare talent. When you're fighting cripples, anyway.",4,4,9
4736,jaime, m,jaime, You talk to my brother this way?,4,4,7
4737,jaime, m,jaime, Do you think he did it?,4,4,6
4738,jaime, m,jaime, We're done for today.,4,4,4
4739,jaime, m,jaime, You stood for him in his trial by combat at the Eyrie.,4,4,12
4740,jaime, m,jaime," To tell you the truth, this isn't so bad. Four walls. A pot to piss in. I was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months.",4,4,30
4741,jaime, m,jaime, Maybe a bit. I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.,4,4,9
4742,jaime, m,jaime, How do you think? Her son died in her arms.,4,4,10
4743,jaime, m,jaime, Don't. You know what's coming?,4,4,5
4744,jaime, m,jaime," Now that you mention it, she did ask.",4,4,8
4745,jaime, m,jaime, Depends. Did you do it?,4,4,5
4746,jaime, m,jaime, Are you really asking if I'd kill my brother? How can I help you?,4,4,14
4747,jaime, m,jaime, You know I can't.,4,4,4
4748,jaime, m,jaime, What do you want me to do? Kill the guards? Sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart? I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.,4,4,29
4749,jaime, m,jaime, Inappropriate? You're accused of killing the king.Freeing you is treason.,4,4,10
4750,jaime, m,jaime," Which is why we're having a trial. A trial. If the killer threw himself before the Iron Throne, confessed to his crimes, and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt, it wouldn't matter to Cersei. She won't rest until my head's on a spike.",4,4,43
4751,jaime, m,jaime, Not just yours. She's offering a knighthood to whomever finds Sansa Stark.,4,4,12
4752,jaime, m,jaime," You sent for me, Your Grace?",4,4,6
4753,jaime, m,jaime, Ser Boros is on duty tonight. Tomorrow I believe...,4,4,9
4754,jaime, m,jaime, I promise you Tommen's safe. We're protecting him.,4,4,8
4755,jaime, m,jaime, What?,4,4,1
4756,jaime, m,jaime, You know why. She'd hoped I'd send her daughters back to her.,4,4,12
4757,jaime, m,jaime," I swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive, I'd return them to her.",4,4,17
4758,jaime, m,jaime, I wanted to get back to you. Should I have told hert o fuck off?,4,4,15
4759,jaime, m,jaime," Catelyn Stark's dead. So if I told you to leave the capital right now and find Sansa, if I told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head, would you do it?",4,4,36
4760,jaime, m,jaime, I had to see him. I had to know for myself.,4,4,11
4761,jaime, m,jaime," He didn't do it, Cersei.",4,4,5
4762,jaime, m,jaime, It's the duty of the Lord Commander to fill those pages. And there's still room left on mine.,4,4,18
4763,jaime, m,jaime, Mmm. It's yours.,4,4,3
4764,jaime, m,jaime," It was reforged from Ned Stark's sword. You'll use it to defend Ned Stark's daughter. You swore an oath to return the Stark girls to their mother. Lady Stark's dead. Arya's probably dead, too, but there's still a chance to find Sansa and get her somewhere safe. I've got something else for you.",4,4,53
4765,jaime, m,jaime, I hope I got your measurements right.,4,4,7
4766,jaime, m,jaime, I almost forgot. I have one more gift.,4,4,8
4767,jaime, m,jaime, Of course you do.,4,4,4
4768,jaime, m,jaime, My brother owes him a debt. He's not safe here. You're keeping him from harm. It's chivalry.,4,4,17
4769,jaime, m,jaime, See? He's a good lad.You'll get along.,4,4,7
4770,jaime, m,jaime, They say the best swords have names. Any ideas?,4,4,9
4771,jaime, m,jaime," Good-bye, Brienne.",4,4,2
4772,jaime, m,jaime, Father's orders.,6,4,2
4773,jaime, m,jaime, You'd condemn your own son to death?,6,4,7
4774,jaime, m,jaime, This isn't a trial. It's a farce. Cersei has manipulated everything and you know it.,6,4,15
4775,jaime, m,jaime,  You've always hated Tyrion.,6,4,4
4776,jaime, m,jaime, As did I. Do you know the last order the Mad King gave me? To bring him your head. I saved your life so you could murder my brother?,6,4,29
4777,jaime, m,jaime,  Justice?,6,4,1
4778,jaime, m,jaime, He'll be executed.,6,4,3
4779,jaime, m,jaime," Once you said family is what lives on. All that lives on. You told me about a dynasty that would last 1,000 years. What happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies? I'm a Kingsguard, forbidden by oath to carry on the family line.",6,4,43
4780,jaime, m,jaime, What happens to your name? Who carries the lion banner into future battles? Your nephews? Lancel Lannister? Others whose names I don't even remember?,6,4,24
4781,jaime, m,jaime, It survives through me. I'll leave the Kingsguard. I'll take my place as your son and heir if you let Tyrion live.,6,4,22
4782,jaime, m,jaime, You have my word.,6,4,4
4783,jaime, m,jaime, You're going to be found guilty.,6,4,6
4784,jaime, m,jaime," When you are, you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the Wall. Father's agreed to it. He'll spare your life and allow you to join the Night's Watch.",6,4,36
4785,jaime, m,jaime, Father is not Joffrey. He'll keep his word.,6,4,8
4786,jaime, m,jaime, Do you trust me?,6,4,4
4787,jaime, m,jaime, Keep your mouth shut. No more outbursts. This will all be over soon.,6,4,13
4788,jaime, m,jaime, I made a deal for you to keep your ungrateful head on your ungrateful neck a little while longer.,7,4,19
4789,jaime, m,jaime," You threw your life away. You threw it away. It's not a joke. You understand that, don't you?",7,4,18
4790,jaime, m,jaime, You fell in love with a whore.,7,4,7
4791,jaime, m,jaime, Careful. I'm the last friend you've got.,7,4,7
4792,jaime, m,jaime," Yes, brilliant speech. They'll be talking about it for days to come. I thought you were a realist. Didn't realize you'd die for pride.",7,4,24
4793,jaime, m,jaime, I can't save you this time either. My training has proved that I can't beat a stable boy with my left hand.,7,4,22
4794,jaime, m,jaime, (laughs),7,4,1
4795,jaime, m,jaime, It is tempting.,7,4,3
4796,jaime, m,jaime, If he wins.,7,4,3
4797,jaime, m,jaime, No. Not Ser Meryn.,7,4,4
4798,jaime, m,jaime, Prince Doran. (bows),9,5,3
4799,jaime, m,jaime, Princess Myrcella.,9,5,2
4800,jaime, m,jaime, What a lovely dress.,9,5,4
4801,jaime, m,jaime, You must be cold.,9,5,4
4802,jaime, m,jaime, Prince Trystane. How’s your jaw?,9,5,5
4803,jaime, m,jaime," Looking out for the safety of my niece, the princess Myrcella.",9,5,11
4804,jaime, m,jaime, We received a threatening message. The princess’s necklace in the jaws of a viper.,9,5,14
4805,jaime, m,jaime, Ah. Excellent. The last meal before the beheading.,9,5,8
4806,jaime, m,jaime, I’m afraid he does.,9,5,4
4807,jaime, m,jaime, I accept.,9,5,2
4808,jaime, m,jaime, You have my word.,9,5,4
4809,jaime, m,jaime, May I inquire into the fate of my man?,9,5,9
4810,jaime, m,jaime, He said it was just a fleabite. The fault is mine. Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders. If anyone should be punished it’s me.,9,5,26
4811,jaime, m,jaime, You’re a good man.,9,5,4
4812,jaime, m,jaime," Prince Doran, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.",9,5,7
4813,jaime, m,jaime, I believe you’ve already met Prince Trystane.,9,5,7
4814,jaime, m,jaime, Prince Trystane here is a man of mercy. He’s agreed to grant you your freedom.,9,5,15
4815,jaime, m,jaime, There was one condition.,9,5,4
4816,jaime, m,jaime, Your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me.,9,5,10
4817,jaime, m,jaime, She will.,9,5,2
4818,jaime, m,jaime," Of course, she’s my niece.",9,5,5
4819,jaime, m,jaime, Thank you.,10,5,2
4820,jaime, m,jaime," Whenever you’re ready, My Lord.",10,5,5
4821,jaime, m,jaime, Try not to lose it this time.,10,5,7
4822,jaime, m,jaime, I know you didn’t want to leave Dorne. But I’m glad you’re coming home. Your mother’s desperate to see you. And I’m glad Trystane’s coming with us. He seems like a nice boy. You’re lucky. Arranged marriages are rarely so… so well arranged.,10,5,43
4823,jaime, m,jaime," If she sees you’re happy, I’m sure she will.",10,5,9
4824,jaime, m,jaime, Have you ever known your mother to like anyone aside from her children?,10,5,13
4825,jaime, m,jaime," I’m not so sure about that. Listen. There’s something I’ve wanted to tell you. Something I should have told you long ago. So. Now that you’ve seen more of the world, you’ve learned how complicated things can be. People can be. The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years, but you’ve fallen in love with Trystane. It was an accident, really, I mean what were the chances? You happen to fall in love with the man you were assigned to marry? (Myrcella laughs) My point is… we don’t choose whom we love. We just… It’s beyond our control. I sound like an idiot.",10,5,106
4826,jaime, m,jaime, What I’m trying to say. What I’m trying and failing to say…,10,5,12
4827,jaime, m,jaime, No. I’m afraid you don’t.,10,5,5
4828,jaime, m,jaime, Myrcella?,10,5,1
4829,jaime, m,jaime, Myrcella?!,10,5,1
4830,jaime, m,jaime, Myrcella?! Myrcella?!,10,5,2
4831,jaime, m,jaime, A summons from the queen.,2,5,5
4832,jaime, m,jaime, It’s a threat.,2,5,3
4833,jaime, m,jaime, No note.,2,5,2
4834,jaime, m,jaime, Softer.,2,5,1
4835,jaime, m,jaime, Not so loud.,2,5,3
4836,jaime, m,jaime, The world can't know knows she’s our daughter.,2,5,8
4837,jaime, m,jaime," If I was the father to any of my children, they’d be stoned in the streets.",2,5,16
4838,jaime, m,jaime, I’ll make things better.,2,5,4
4839,jaime, m,jaime, I’m going to Dorne. I’ll bring our daughter home.,2,5,9
4840,jaime, m,jaime, I’m not going to ask him anything.,2,5,7
4841,jaime, m,jaime, No army. Do you know where they’re keeping her?,2,5,9
4842,jaime, m,jaime," I’ll find her. Is there anything else, your grace?",2,5,9
4843,jaime, m,jaime, I never said I was going alone. (exit Jaime),2,5,9
4844,jaime, m,jaime, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.,2,5,5
4845,jaime, m,jaime, Thank you.,2,5,2
4846,jaime, m,jaime, A pleasure. (he kisses her hand),2,5,6
4847,jaime, m,jaime, Beautiful bride you've chosen. When were you planning on getting married?,2,5,11
4848,jaime, m,jaime, On with what?,2,5,3
4849,jaime, m,jaime, It's very good for you.,2,5,5
4850,jaime, m,jaime, Mmm.,2,5,1
4851,jaime, m,jaime, I would have advised against that.,2,5,6
4852,jaime, m,jaime," 'Cause you're going to come with me and help me with something important. And when we return, I'm going to give you a much better girl, and a much better castle.",2,5,31
4853,jaime, m,jaime, As far south as south goes.,2,5,6
4854,jaime, m,jaime," What he built. The towers. He built it for us. He meant it for us. They’re going to try to take it away, all of it.",1,5,26
4855,jaime, m,jaime, All of them out there are enemies. They’re waiting a night to make sure he’s really dead and as soon as they see the stones on his eyes they’ll set to work on tearing us apart.,1,5,36
4856,jaime, m,jaime, This is exactly what they want.,1,5,6
4857,jaime, m,jaime, Is that Estermont?,4,5,3
4858,jaime, m,jaime," This ship's sailing to Oldtown. We'll get off earlier, not far from Sunspear. Row ourselves to the Dornish shores in the night.",4,5,22
4859,jaime, m,jaime, No.,4,5,1
4860,jaime, m,jaime, You should be happy to go back. (Drinks some water).,4,5,10
4861,jaime, m,jaime," We are not kidnapping their princess. We are rescuing my niece, bringing her back to the family,",4,5,17
4862,jaime, m,jaime, That's why you're here.,4,5,4
4863,jaime, m,jaime, Because I don't want to start a war.,4,5,8
4864,jaime, m,jaime, It has to be me.,4,5,5
4865,jaime, m,jaime, It has to be me.,4,5,5
4866,jaime, m,jaime, (Quietly) Varys set him free.,4,5,5
4867,jaime, m,jaime," He murdered my father. If I ever see him, I'll split him in two. And then I'll give him your regards.",4,5,21
4868,jaime, m,jaime," As far as I've seen, they're all shit ways to die.",4,5,11
4869,jaime, m,jaime, I don't care what's sung about me when I'm dead.,4,5,10
4870,jaime, m,jaime, Sounds like all the rest.,4,5,5
4871,jaime, m,jaime, What about you? What shit way would you choose?,4,5,9
4872,jaime, m,jaime, How disappointing. I thought you'd have something more exciting planned.,4,5,10
4873,jaime, m,jaime, In the arms of the woman I love.,4,5,8
4874,jaime, m,jaime, Let's go.,4,5,2
4875,jaime, m,jaime, Pentoshi.,4,5,1
4876,jaime, m,jaime, As I said. Why?,4,5,4
4877,jaime, m,jaime, A bag of gold.,4,5,4
4878,jaime, m,jaime, It was a heavy bag.,4,5,5
4879,jaime, m,jaime, Four.,4,5,1
4880,jaime, m,jaime," One, if he's slow.",4,5,4
4881,jaime, m,jaime, I thought the sharks would get us. (Bronn looks at him).,4,5,11
4882,jaime, m,jaime, I could have sworn those were shark fins.,4,5,8
4883,jaime, m,jaime, Luck.,4,5,1
4884,jaime, m,jaime, First we need to bury these bodies.,4,5,7
4885,jaime, m,jaime," Corpses raise questions, questions raise armies. We're not here to start a war.",4,5,13
4886,jaime, m,jaime," (Holding out his hand). I can't dig very well with one hand. Not at all, really.",4,5,16
4887,jaime, m,jaime," Alright, thats enough.",6,5,3
4888,jaime, m,jaime, We’re trying to blend in. We don’t want everyone in Dorne to hear your accent.,6,5,15
4889,jaime, m,jaime, It can wait. Up there.,6,5,5
4890,jaime, m,jaime, That’s the Water Gardens.,6,5,4
4891,jaime, m,jaime, I like to improvise.,6,5,4
4892,jaime, m,jaime, Myrcella.,6,5,1
4893,jaime, m,jaime, Let’s speak in private.,6,5,4
4894,jaime, m,jaime, Excellent. Good to meet you.,6,5,5
4895,jaime, m,jaime," We have to go, Myrcella, now.",6,5,6
4896,jaime, m,jaime," You’ll be fine, I promise, but we have to--",6,5,9
4897,jaime, m,jaime, And more hands. How’s Trystane?,7,5,5
4898,jaime, m,jaime, I’m sorry for that. It wasn’t supposed to happen that way.,7,5,11
4899,jaime, m,jaime, Your mother’s worried about you. Threats have been made. Dorne is too dangerous for you. I’ve come to take you home.,7,5,21
4900,jaime, m,jaime, It's for your own good. These are complicated matters.,7,5,9
4901,jaime, m,jaime, I don’t understand.,7,5,3
4902,jaime, m,jaime, Damn.,8,2,1
4903,jaime, m,jaime," You're much uglier in daylight. What's your name? I'm Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock, son of Tywin.",8,2,17
4904,jaime, m,jaime, A captive knight has a right to know his captor's identity.,8,2,11
4905,jaime, m,jaime," Tarth, Tarth, Tarth. Crescent moons and starbursts. Lord Selwyn Tarth. Your father. Do you have any brothers and sisters, my lady? It's a long way to King's Landing. Might as well get to know one another.",8,2,36
4906,jaime, m,jaime, Have you known many men? I suppose not. Women? Horses? Ah.,8,2,11
4907,jaime, m,jaime," I didn't mean to give offense, my lady. Forgive me.",8,2,10
4908,jaime, m,jaime, Why do you hate me so much? Have I ever harmed you?,8,2,12
4909,jaime, m,jaime, Has anyone ever told you you're as boring as you are ugly?,8,2,12
4910,jaime, m,jaime, I already have. Look at you. You're ready to chop my head off. Do you think you could? Do you think you could beat me in a fair fight?,8,2,29
4911,jaime, m,jaime, The answer is no. There are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me. You're not one of them.,8,2,23
4912,jaime, m,jaime," If you're so confident, unlock my chains. Let's see what happens.",8,2,11
4913,jaime, m,jaime," I took you for a fighter, a man Pardon. Woman of honor. Was I wrong? You're afraid.",8,2,17
4914,jaime, m,jaime," You're a virgin, I take it?",10,2,6
4915,jaime, m,jaime," Childhood must have been awful for you. Were you a foot taller than all the boys? They laughed at you, called you names? Some boys like a challenge. One or two must have tried to get inside Big Brienne.",10,2,39
4916,jaime, m,jaime," Ah. But you fought them off. But maybe you wished one of them could overpower you, fling you down, tear off your clothes. But none of them were strong enough. I'm strong enough.",10,2,33
4917,jaime, m,jaime, Of course you are. You'd love to know what it feels like to be a woman.,10,2,16
4918,jaime, m,jaime," Ah. ""They lay with lions."" Tavern girls, I'd say. Probably served my father's soldiers. Maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel. That's how they earned this. The glorious work of the Northern freedom fighters. Must make you proud to serve the Starks.",10,2,46
4919,jaime, m,jaime, Tell yourself that tonight when they swing in your dreams.,10,2,10
4920,jaime, m,jaime, What are you doing?,10,2,4
4921,jaime, m,jaime, We shouldn't stay here. We should get back on the river.,10,2,11
4922,jaime, m,jaime, Untie me. Now!,10,2,3
4923,jaime, m,jaime, Apparently eating is now a crime. Who knew?,10,2,8
4924,jaime, m,jaime, But it's not a crime to starve. That's justice for you.,10,2,11
4925,jaime, m,jaime, For stealing a pig?,10,2,4
4926,jaime, m,jaime, Have you been to Ashemark?,10,2,5
4927,jaime, m,jaime, Then you don't know me.,10,2,5
4928,jaime, m,jaime, Is it near Ashemark?,10,2,4
4929,jaime, m,jaime, I've never been there.,10,2,4
4930,jaime, m,jaime, I wish someone had told me. I wouldn't have had to steal that pig.,10,2,14
4931,jaime, m,jaime, Those were Stark men.,10,2,4
4932,jaime, m,jaime, You think my father’s going to negotiate with you? You don’t know him very well.,2,2,15
4933,jaime, m,jaime," King in the North. I keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping, but you drag me along from camp to camp. Have you grown fond of me, Stark? Is that it? I've never seen you with a girl.",1,2,44
4934,jaime, m,jaime, You don't trust the loyalty of the men following you into battle?,1,2,12
4935,jaime, m,jaime, Smart boy. What's wrong? Don't like being called ‘boy’? Insulted?,1,2,10
4936,jaime, m,jaime," If that's true, Stannis is the rightful king. How convenient for him.",1,2,12
4937,jaime, m,jaime, I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head.,1,2,10
4938,jaime, m,jaime, You have proof? Or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives?,1,2,15
4939,jaime, m,jaime, You think my father's going to negotiate with you? You don't know him very well.,1,2,15
4940,jaime, m,jaime, Three victories don't make you a conqueror.,1,2,7
4941,jaime, m,jaime, Is she the fat one?,7,2,5
4942,jaime, m,jaime," No, no. There's only one fat Lannister. If she was your mother, you'd know it.",7,2,15
4943,jaime, m,jaime, When?,7,2,1
4944,jaime, m,jaime, I went to Willem Frey's wedding?,7,2,6
4945,jaime, m,jaime, He threw up on his horse on the way to the tourney grounds. What was his name?,7,2,17
4946,jaime, m,jaime," Poor lad. That was my brother's doing, I seem to recall. I remember you. You'd never squired for anyone before.",7,2,20
4947,jaime, m,jaime," You didn't, though.",7,2,3
4948,jaime, m,jaime," You knew when you were needed and when to go away. It's a rare talent. Most of my squires, they mean well, but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them.",7,2,33
4949,jaime, m,jaime, You were saying?,7,2,3
4950,jaime, m,jaime, More embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit?,7,2,13
4951,jaime, m,jaime, I understand completely.,7,2,3
4952,jaime, m,jaime, It's just that I I was 16 once. I also had to replace someone's squire on short notice.,7,2,18
4953,jaime, m,jaime, Barristan Selmy. The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws. Before your time.,7,2,11
4954,jaime, m,jaime," He was A painter. A painter who only used red. I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that, not back then. And to help him do that, to be a part of something that perfect. I don't need to explain how that felt, not to you.",7,2,47
4955,jaime, m,jaime," It's like stepping into a dream you've been dreaming for as long as you can remember, and finding out that the dream is more real than your life.",7,2,28
4956,jaime, m,jaime," No. I didn't have your gift. He couldn't take a step without stepping on me. I was awful, a complete liability. Until one of the outlaws decided to take on a 16-year-old squire.",7,2,33
4957,jaime, m,jaime," It's a good thing I am who I am. I'd have been useless at anything else. I'm not well-suited for imprisonment. Shocking, I know. Some men are. Ned Stark, I imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end. Not me, though. My life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint.",7,2,53
4958,jaime, m,jaime, Of course. Every day.,7,2,4
4959,jaime, m,jaime," Good prisoners breed good jailers, apparently. The Starks are very careful.",7,2,11
4960,jaime, m,jaime," But there is a way, I think. It wasn't possible until now.",7,2,12
4961,jaime, m,jaime, It's actually quite simple.,7,2,4
4962,jaime, m,jaime, You'll only have to do one thing.,7,2,7
4963,jaime, m,jaime, (whispers)You'll have to die.,7,2,4
4964,jaime, m,jaime," Thank you for fighting on my behalf, Lady Stark. I would have come to your defense, but",7,2,17
4965,jaime, m,jaime, You've become a real she-wolf in your later years. There's not much fish left in you.,7,2,16
4966,jaime, m,jaime," Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark? I believe it's my last night in this world. Is that a woman?",7,2,19
4967,jaime, m,jaime, Old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.,7,2,8
4968,jaime, m,jaime, Oh. Oh. Was he the one on guard duty? He was in my way. Any knight would have done the same.,7,2,21
4969,jaime, m,jaime," So many vows. They make you swear and swear. Defend the king, obey the king, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak. But what if your father despises the king? What if the king massacres the innocent? It's too much. No matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or another. Where did you find this beast?",7,2,59
4970,jaime, m,jaime," Kingslayer. What a king he was. Here's to Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm, and to the sword I shoved in his back.",7,2,33
4971,jaime, m,jaime," Do you know, I've never been with any woman but Cersei. So in my own way, I have more honor than poor old dead Ned. What was the name of that bastard he fathered?",7,2,34
4972,jaime, m,jaime," No, that wasn't it. Snow, a bastard from the North. Now, when When good old Ned came home with some whore's baby, did you pretend to love it? No. You're not very good at pretending. You're an honest woman. You hated that boy, didn't you? How could you not hate him? The walking, talking reminder that the honorable Lord Eddard Stark fucked another woman.",7,2,64
4973,jaime, m,jaime,"  This same mob spat at my sister not long ago, and if you turn on us, they'll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike.",3,7,26
4974,jaime, m,jaime,  Advice?,3,7,1
4975,jaime, m,jaime,  No.,3,7,1
4976,jaime, m,jaime,  Don't.,3,7,1
4977,jaime, m,jaime,  What are you doing?  No one can see us like this ?,3,7,12
4978,jaime, m,jaime,  It is.,3,7,2
4979,jaime, m,jaime,  I suppose as well as can be expected.,3,7,8
4980,jaime, m,jaime,"  The truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore.  Well, it is to me.  My fond childhood memories won't keep Cersei on the throne.",3,7,24
4981,jaime, m,jaime,"  For now.  They won't be able to hold it.  Euron Greyjoy's navy burned their ships, we emptied the larders before we left.  Eventually they'll be forced to abandon their position and march all the way across Westeros.",3,7,37
4982,jaime, m,jaime,  As Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood.  There are always lessons in failures.,3,7,15
4983,jaime, m,jaime,  My father always said I was a slow learner.,3,7,9
4984,jaime, m,jaime,  Widow's Wail.,3,7,2
4985,jaime, m,jaime,"  To you, sure.  To others as well.  But after we've won and there's no one left to oppose us, the people living peaceful in the world she built, do you really think they'll wring their hands over the way she built it?",3,7,42
4986,jaime, m,jaime,"  Possibly.  Not much to be gained from discussing it with you though, is there?",3,7,14
4987,jaime, m,jaime,"  Yes, it has.",3,7,3
4988,jaime, m,jaime,  I think we're done here.,3,7,5
4989,jaime, m,jaime,  Cersei had several ideas.  Whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the Red Keep.  Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of King's Landing.  I talked her out of those.,3,7,36
4990,jaime, m,jaime,  No.  I made sure of that.,3,7,6
4991,jaime, m,jaime,  Lord Tarley.,2,7,2
4992,jaime, m,jaime,"  Rickon, isn't it?",2,7,3
4993,jaime, m,jaime,  That's it.,2,7,2
4994,jaime, m,jaime,  Thank you for coming.  The other lords of the Reach look to you for guidance now more than ever.  They might not have come if you hadn't.,2,7,27
4995,jaime, m,jaime,  Do you ride for Hornhill today?,2,7,6
4996,jaime, m,jaime,  And what side will you be fighting for?  You were the only man to defeat Robert Baratheon in battle.  Not even Rhaegar Targaryen could --,2,7,25
4997,jaime, m,jaime,  I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come.  I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei and I want you to help her destroy her enemies.  All of her enemies.,2,7,35
4998,jaime, m,jaime,"  You swore an oath to the Crown as well, Lord Tarley.",2,7,11
4999,jaime, m,jaime,"  She was a great woman, once.  Now she's broken.  She wants revenge so badly she brought the Dothraki to our shores.  The Dothraki in Westeros for the first time in history.  I know you don't like my sister, but you have to make a choice.  Do you fight with us or with the foreign savages and eunuchs?",2,7,57
5000,jaime, m,jaime,  When the war is won the queen will need a new warden of the south.  I can think of no better man than Randyll Tarley.,2,7,25
5001,jaime, m,jaime, What is this?,1,7,3
5002,jaime, m,jaime," He knew it. Made me memorize every damn city, town, lake, forest, and mountain.",1,7,14
5003,jaime, m,jaime," No, not angry.",1,7,3
5004,jaime, m,jaime, Should I be?,1,7,3
5005,jaime, m,jaime, Dragonstone.,1,7,1
5006,jaime, m,jaime," They have deep-water ports for the ships. Stannis left the castle unoccupied, and that's where she was born.",1,7,18
5007,jaime, m,jaime," Winter is here. We can't win a war if we can't feed our men and our horses. The Tyrells have the grain, the Tyrells have the livestock.",1,7,27
5008,jaime, m,jaime," If they think Daenerys will win. No one wants to fight on the losing side. Right now, we look like the losing side.",1,7,23
5009,jaime, m,jaime," Three kingdoms, at best. I'm not sure you understand how much danger we're in.",1,7,14
5010,jaime, m,jaime, A dynasty for whom? Our children are dead. We're the last of us.,1,7,13
5011,jaime, m,jaime, We never talked about Tommen.,1,7,5
5012,jaime, m,jaime, Our baby boy killed himself.,1,7,5
5013,jaime, m,jaime, Cersei--,1,7,1
5014,jaime, m,jaime, Even Lannisters can't survive without allies. Where are our allies now? You saw what happened to Walder Frey and his family.,1,7,21
5015,jaime, m,jaime," We couldn't. He was a useless, old coward, but the Freys supported us. Now they're all dead. Whoever killed them is no friend of ours. We need allies. Stronger, better allies. We can't win this war alone.",1,7,37
5016,jaime, m,jaime, The Greyjoys? You invited the Greyjoys to King's Landing?,1,7,9
5017,jaime, m,jaime," Well, it looks like all of them.",1,7,7
5018,jaime, m,jaime, How are they better allies? How are they different from the Freys? They both broke their promises and murdered their former friends as soon as it suited them.,1,7,28
5019,jaime, m,jaime," They're not good at anything. I know the Ironborn. They're bitter, angry little people. All they know how to do is steal things they can't build or grow themselves.",1,7,29
5020,jaime, m,jaime," Oh, what did he come here for, then?",1,7,8
5021,jaime, m,jaime," You're not a rightful monarch, though, are you?",1,7,8
5022,jaime, m,jaime," The Greyjoys rebelled agains the throne for the right to be monarchs, but as I recall, you were soundly defeated. Come to mention it, weren't you the one who started that rebellion by sailing to Casterly Rock and burning the Lannister fleet? You certainly caught us there. Very smart move on your part. Of course, we all made it to the Iron Islands anyway. I was there.",1,7,67
5023,jaime, m,jaime, The people I was cutting down were your own kin.,1,7,10
5024,jaime, m,jaime, And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.,1,7,5
5025,jaime, m,jaime,  You could have killed me.,5,7,5
5026,jaime, m,jaime,  Ending the war by killing her.,5,7,6
5027,jaime, m,jaime,"  That was only one of them.  She has two more.  If she decides to use them, to really use them --",5,7,21
5028,jaime, m,jaime,  Don't you mean we're fucked?,5,7,5
5029,jaime, m,jaime,  I have to tell Cersei.,5,7,5
5030,jaime, m,jaime,  We haven't done a full counting.,5,7,6
5031,jaime, m,jaime,"  I just saw the Dothraki fight.  They'll beat any mercenary army.  They'll beat any army I've ever seen.  Killing our men wasn't war for them, it was sport.  Her dragon burned a thousand wagons.  Qyburn's scorpion fired bolts bigger than you.  They couldn't stop it.  And she has three of them.  This isn't a war we can win.",5,7,58
5032,jaime, m,jaime,  He didn't.,5,7,2
5033,jaime, m,jaime,  I'm not talking about father.  Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey.  He had nothing to do with it.,5,7,16
5034,jaime, m,jaime,  It was Olenna.  She confessed before she died.,5,7,8
5035,jaime, m,jaime,  After.,5,7,1
5036,jaime, m,jaime,  If you were Olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen?  Which one would Margerey been better able to control?  Which one would have made Olenna the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms?  She was telling the truth.,5,7,43
5037,jaime, m,jaime,"  She's dead like her son, her grandchildren, her whole house.  And if we don't find a way out of this war we'll follow them.",5,7,24
5038,jaime, m,jaime,  We don't have time for this.  We should be preparing the city for a siege.  The Dothraki are coming.,5,7,19
5039,jaime, m,jaime,  I seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well.,5,7,13
5040,jaime, m,jaime,  Why down here?,5,7,3
5041,jaime, m,jaime,  Today might be the day I kill you by accident.,5,7,10
5042,jaime, m,jaime,  Don't talk about our father.,5,7,5
5043,jaime, m,jaime,  I once told Bronn that if I ever saw you again I'd cut you in half.,5,7,16
5044,jaime, m,jaime,  What do you want?,5,7,4
5045,jaime, m,jaime,  You want Cersei to bend the knee you can ask her yourself.,5,7,12
5046,jaime, m,jaime,  Why was QYBURN here?,5,7,4
5047,jaime, m,jaime,  I met with Tyrion.,5,7,4
5048,jaime, m,jaime,  Daenerys wants to meet.,5,7,4
5049,jaime, m,jaime,  To discuss an armistice.,5,7,4
5050,jaime, m,jaime,  Because an army of dead men is marching on the Seven Kingdoms.  Tyrion claims he'll have proof.,5,7,17
5051,jaime, m,jaime,  Tyrion?,5,7,1
5052,jaime, m,jaime,  You let it happen.  Why?,5,7,5
5053,jaime, m,jaime,  Who will you say is the father?,5,7,7
5054,jaime, m,jaime,  People won't like that.,5,7,4
5055,jaime, m,jaime,  The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.,5,7,11
5056,jaime, m,jaime,  Halt that wagon!,4,7,3
5057,jaime, m,jaime,  I'll save my confessions for the High Septon.,4,7,8
5058,jaime, m,jaime,"  No, there isn't, is there?",4,7,5
5059,jaime, m,jaime,  That's a lot of money I just gave you.,4,7,9
5060,jaime, m,jaime,  You don't want Highgarden.,4,7,4
5061,jaime, m,jaime,"  We're at war.  Daenerys Targaryen could come take it back the day after you move in.  Besides, think of the upkeep.  The more you own, the more it weighs you down.",4,7,31
5062,jaime, m,jaime,  They're not mine.  The gold belongs to the Iron Bank.  We pay our debts.,4,7,14
5063,jaime, m,jaime,"  Bronn of the Blackwater, formerly of whatever nameless shit heap you're from with a saddlebag full of gold complaining about not getting paid.  When we win this war all the castles in the Seven Kingdoms will be yours to choose from with no one left to take them away from you.",4,7,51
5064,jaime, m,jaime,  Stranger things have happened.,4,7,4
5065,jaime, m,jaime,  The current harvest?,4,7,3
5066,jaime, m,jaime,"  Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarleys and help them accelerate this process?",4,7,13
5067,jaime, m,jaime,"  No, but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest, I've heard you guys have a real talent for that.",4,7,20
5068,jaime, m,jaime,  Good.,4,7,1
5069,jaime, m,jaime,  We are stretched a bit thin.,4,7,6
5070,jaime, m,jaime,  Let's give them fair warning first.  These men fought well at Highgarden.,4,7,12
5071,jaime, m,jaime,  Rickon.,4,7,1
5072,jaime, m,jaime,  I hear you fought bravely at Highgarden.  Your first battle?,4,7,10
5073,jaime, m,jaime,  And?,4,7,1
5074,jaime, m,jaime,  They didn't deserve to die.  But Lady Olenna chose to betray the queen and support the Targaryen girl.  So here we are.,4,7,22
5075,jaime, m,jaime,  What?,4,7,1
5076,jaime, m,jaime,  Spears and shields!  Spears and shields!,4,7,6
5077,jaime, m,jaime,  Spears and shields!,4,7,3
5078,jaime, m,jaime,  I'm not abandoning my army.,4,7,5
5079,jaime, m,jaime,  We can hold them off.,4,7,5
5080,jaime, m,jaime,  Hold the line!,4,7,3
5081,jaime, m,jaime,  Archers!  Archers with me!,4,7,4
5082,jaime, m,jaime,  Knock!,4,7,1
5083,jaime, m,jaime,  Loose!,4,7,1
5084,jaime, m,jaime,  Qyburn's scorpion is over there.,4,7,5
5085,jaime, m,jaime,  I can't shoot with one hand.,4,7,6
5086,jaime, m,jaime,  Come on!,4,7,2
5087,jaime, m,jaime,  Take cover!,4,7,2
5088,jaime, m,jaime,"  Come on, boy.  Come on!",4,7,5
5089,jaime, m,jaime, The thrill will fade.,7,7,4
5090,jaime, m,jaime, Gold?,7,7,1
5091,jaime, m,jaime, Family.,7,7,1
5092,jaime, m,jaime, Maybe it really is all cocks in the end.,7,7,9
5093,jaime, m,jaime," Yes, he's always been a champion of the downtrodden.",7,7,9
5094,jaime, m,jaime, Perhaps you ought to sit down.,7,7,6
5095,jaime, m,jaime, How many?,7,7,2
5096,jaime, m,jaime, It's been good to see you. I imagine the next time will be across a battlefield.,7,7,16
5097,jaime, m,jaime," Yes, and I'm not looking forward to seeing more of them. But I'm loyal to the queen and you're loyal to Sansa and her dolt brother.",7,7,26
5098,jaime, m,jaime, Fuck loyalty?,7,7,2
5099,jaime, m,jaime, And tell her what?,7,7,4
5100,jaime, m,jaime," At her until she kicked me out. She thinks I was an idiot to trust you. A lot of people seem to think that, actually.",7,7,25
5101,jaime, m,jaime," I suppose we should say goodbye, one idiot to another.",7,7,10
5102,jaime, m,jaime, Our men in King's Landing will march north in three days' time.,7,7,12
5103,jaime, m,jaime," We don't have a fortnight. If the North falls, we fall. Three days. The remaining forces in the Westerlands will take the river road east. We'll meet at Lord Harroway's Town and march together to Winterfell.",7,7,36
5104,jaime, m,jaime, Your Grace.,7,7,2
5105,jaime, m,jaime, Preparing the expedition north.,7,7,4
5106,jaime, m,jaime, You pledged our forces to fight our common enemy.,7,7,9
5107,jaime, m,jaime, You saw it with your own eyes. You saw a dead man trying to kill us.,7,7,16
5108,jaime, m,jaime," This isn't about noble houses, this is about the living and the dead!",7,7,13
5109,jaime, m,jaime, I made a promise.,7,7,4
5110,jaime, m,jaime, Our child will never be born if the dead come south.,7,7,11
5111,jaime, m,jaime, And then what?,7,7,3
5112,jaime, m,jaime," When the fighting in the North is over, someone wins. You understand that, don't you? If the dead win, they march south and kill us all. If the living win, and we've betrayed them, they march south and kill us all!",7,7,41
5113,jaime, m,jaime, I faced them in the field. We can't beat them. We can't beat their dragons.,7,7,15
5114,jaime, m,jaime, Two.,7,7,1
5115,jaime, m,jaime," For all we know, it's guarding her fleet!",7,7,8
5116,jaime, m,jaime, We can't beat the Dothraki. We don't have the numbers. We don't have the support of the other houses!,7,7,19
5117,jaime, m,jaime, The Golden Company is not here. They're in Essos. How is a mercenary company in Essos going to help us?,7,7,20
5118,jaime, m,jaime," You plotted with Euron Greyjoy without telling me, the commander.",7,7,10
5119,jaime, m,jaime, I didn't conspire with him.,7,7,5
5120,jaime, m,jaime, I pledged to ride north. I intend to honor that pledge.,7,7,11
5121,jaime, m,jaime, Treason?,7,7,1
5122,jaime, m,jaime, Doesn't matter what I'd call it.,7,7,6
5123,jaime, m,jaime," Are you going to order him to kill me? I'm the only one you have left. Our children are gone, our father",7,7,22
5124,jaime, m,jaime," Give the order, then.",7,7,4
5125,jaime, m,jaime, I  don't believe you.,7,7,4
5126,jaime, m,jaime, She did.,2,8,2
5127,jaime, m,jaime, She lied to me as well. She never had any intention of sending her army north.,2,8,16
5128,jaime, m,jaime," She has Euron Greyjoy's fleet and 20,000 fresh troops. The Golden Company from Essos, bought and paid for. Even if we defeat the dead, she'll have more than enough to destroy the survivors.",2,8,33
5129,jaime, m,jaime, I promised to fight for the living. I intend to keep that promise.,2,8,13
5130,jaime, m,jaime," Do you want me to apologize? I won't. We were at war. Everything I did, I did for my house and my family. I'd do it all again.",2,8,28
5131,jaime, m,jaime, Because this goes beyond loyalty.,2,8,5
5132,jaime, m,jaime, This is about survival.,2,8,4
5133,jaime, m,jaime," Thank you, Your Grace.",2,8,4
5134,jaime, m,jaime, I'm sorry for what I did to you.,2,8,8
5135,jaime, m,jaime, I'm not that person anymore.,2,8,5
5136,jaime, m,jaime, You're not?,2,8,2
5137,jaime, m,jaime, You're not angry at me.,2,8,5
5138,jaime, m,jaime, Why didn't you tell them?,2,8,5
5139,jaime, m,jaime, What about afterwards?,2,8,3
5140,jaime, m,jaime," Yes, here we are.",2,8,4
5141,jaime, m,jaime, How do they feel about their new queen?,2,8,8
5142,jaime, m,jaime, And she is? Different?,2,8,4
5143,jaime, m,jaime, You're sure about her?,2,8,4
5144,jaime, m,jaime, She didn't seem sure about you.,2,8,6
5145,jaime, m,jaime, Hmm.,2,8,1
5146,jaime, m,jaime," No, that part is real.",2,8,5
5147,jaime, m,jaime, She's always been good at using the truth to tell lies. I wouldn't be too hard on yourself. She's fooled me more than anybody.,2,8,24
5148,jaime, m,jaime, What?,2,8,1
5149,jaime, m,jaime, Your cock.,2,8,2
5150,jaime, m,jaime, Lady Brienne.,2,8,2
5151,jaime, m,jaime, He's come a long way.,2,8,5
5152,jaime, m,jaime, I'm sure you'll teach him. I've been told you're commanding the left flank.,2,8,13
5153,jaime, m,jaime, It is.,2,8,2
5154,jaime, m,jaime," Yes, I think you're right.",2,8,5
5155,jaime, m,jaime, What?,2,8,1
5156,jaime, m,jaime, I truly don't.,2,8,3
5157,jaime, m,jaime, You want me to insult you?,2,8,6
5158,jaime, m,jaime, Good.,2,8,1
5159,jaime, m,jaime," I came to Winterfell because-I'm not the fighter I used to be. But I'd be honored to serve under your command, if you'll have me.",2,8,25
5160,jaime, m,jaime," So, what can we do?",2,8,5
5161,jaime, m,jaime," If that's true, he'll never expose himself.",2,8,7
5162,jaime, m,jaime, That would be something to see.,2,8,6
5163,jaime, m,jaime, Mm.,2,8,1
5164,jaime, m,jaime, It wasn't so simple. I was sleeping with my sister and you had one friend in the world who was sleeping with his sister.,2,8,24
5165,jaime, m,jaime, Do you miss it?,2,8,4
5166,jaime, m,jaime," Well, my golden-lion days are done, but whore-mongering is still an option for you.",2,8,14
5167,jaime, m,jaime, Oh! My lady.,2,8,3
5168,jaime, m,jaime, You really think any of us are going to sleep tonight? Join us.,2,8,13
5169,jaime, m,jaime, I'm sure someone does.,2,8,4
5170,jaime, m,jaime, Fabled loser of the Battle of Whispering Wood.,2,8,8
5171,jaime, m,jaime, You don't need a king. Any knight can make another knight.,2,8,11
5172,jaime, m,jaime, I'll prove it.,2,8,3
5173,jaime, m,jaime," Kneel, Lady Brienne.",2,8,3
5174,jaime, m,jaime, Do you want to be a knight or not? Kneel.,2,8,10
5175,jaime, m,jaime," In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave.",2,8,12
5176,jaime, m,jaime," In the name of the Father, I charge you to be just.",2,8,12
5177,jaime, m,jaime," In the name of the Mother, I charge you to defend the innocent.",2,8,13
5178,jaime, m,jaime," Arise, Brienne of Tarth a knight of the Seven Kingdoms.",2,8,10
5179,jaime, m,jaime, We'd better get some rest.,2,8,5
5180,jaime, m,jaime," We fought dead things and lived to talk about it. If this isn't the time to drink, when is?",4,8,19
5181,jaime, m,jaime, (to BRIENNE) Um You are an only child.,4,8,8
5182,jaime, m,jaime,  You didn't.,4,8,2
5183,jaime, m,jaime, I surmised it.,4,8,3
5184,jaime, m,jaime, You have danced with Renly Baratheon.,4,8,6
5185,jaime, m,jaime,  Drink.,4,8,1
5186,jaime, m,jaime,  Drink.,4,8,1
5187,jaime, m,jaime, That's a statement about the present.,4,8,6
5188,jaime, m,jaime, You didn't drink.,4,8,3
5189,jaime, m,jaime, In the game.,4,8,3
5190,jaime, m,jaime, In the game. This is Dornish.,4,8,6
5191,jaime, m,jaime, Suit yourself.,4,8,2
5192,jaime, m,jaime, You keep it warm enough in here.,4,8,7
5193,jaime, m,jaime, That's very diligent. Very responsible.,4,8,5
5194,jaime, m,jaime,  You know the first thing I learned in the North? I hate the fucking North.,4,8,15
5195,jaime, m,jaime, I don't want things growing on me.,4,8,7
5196,jaime, m,jaime, How about Tormund Giantsbane? Has he grown on you? He was very sad when you left.,4,8,16
5197,jaime, m,jaime,"  (nods) I do, don't I? It's bloody hot in here.",4,8,10
5198,jaime, m,jaime, I'm taking your shirt off.,4,8,5
5199,jaime, m,jaime, I've never slept with a knight before.,4,8,7
5200,jaime, m,jaime, Then you have to drink. Those are the rules.,4,8,9
5201,jaime, m,jaime," She's sworn to protect the Stark girls, so... Say something snide.",4,8,11
5202,jaime, m,jaime, To climbing mountains.,4,8,3
5203,jaime, m,jaime, What? That's not your concern.,4,8,5
5204,jaime, m,jaime, You're a dog.,4,8,3
5205,jaime, m,jaime, What are you doing with that?,4,8,6
5206,jaime, m,jaime, Power resides where men believe--,4,8,5
5207,jaime, m,jaime,  And you trust Cersei--,4,8,4
5208,jaime, m,jaime, Highgarden? Are you mad?,4,8,4
5209,jaime, m,jaime, He's not going to kill us. He wouldn't be talking to us if--,4,8,13
5210,jaime, m,jaime, Highgarden will never belong to a cutthroat.,4,8,7
5211,jaime, m,jaime, What happened?,4,8,2
5212,jaime, m,jaime, Have you ever run away from a fight?,4,8,8
5213,jaime, m,jaime," You think I'm a good man? I pushed a boy out a tower window, crippled him for life for Cersei. I strangled my cousin with my own hands just to get back to Cersei. I would have murdered every man, woman and child in Riverrun for Cersei.",4,8,47
5214,jaime, m,jaime, She's hateful. And so am I.,4,8,6
5215,jaime, m,jaime,"  Lady Stark. l'd offer you my sword, but l seem to have lost it.",9,1,14
5216,jaime, m,jaime,"  l've lost them too, l'm afraid.",9,1,6
5217,jaime, m,jaime,"  You look lovely tonight, Lady Stark. Widowhood becomes you. (Catelyn grabs a large rock from the ground)  Your bed must be lonely. ls that why you came? l'm not at my best, but l think l could be of service. You slip out of that gown and we'll see if l'm up to it. (She marches towards him and hits the rock against his forehead)   Oh, l do like a violent woman.",10,1,72
5218,jaime, m,jaime,"  Let me show you how. Hit me again, over the ear. And again and again. You're stronger than you look, it shouldn't take long.",10,1,24
5219,jaime, m,jaime,"  But l don't, my lady. The dark is coming for all of us. Why cry about it?",10,1,17
5220,jaime, m,jaime,  What gods are those? The trees your husband prayed to? Where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off? lf your gods are real and if they are just why is the world so full of injustice?,10,1,39
5221,jaime, m,jaime,  There are no men like me. Only me.,10,1,8
5222,jaime, m,jaime,  l pushed him out the window.,10,1,6
5223,jaime, m,jaime,  I hoped the fall would kill him.,10,1,7
5224,jaime, m,jaime,  You should get some sleep. lt's going to be a long war. (Catelyn drops the rock and goes away),10,1,19
5225,jaime, m,jaime," Thank the gods you're here, Stark. About time we had some stern northern leadership.",3,1,14
5226,jaime, m,jaime," Sturdy old thing. How many kings' asses have polished it, I wonder? What's the line? The King shits and the Hand wipes.",3,1,22
5227,jaime, m,jaime," I know. People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss.",3,1,16
5228,jaime, m,jaime," I have a knack for it. It must be strange for you coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that.",3,1,46
5229,jaime, m,jaime," 500 men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark. 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later... When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... It felt like justice.",3,1,69
5230,jaime, m,jaime," Tell me... If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?",3,1,20
5231,jaime, m,jaime, Calm down.,3,1,2
5232,jaime, m,jaime, I was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. What has the boy told them?,3,1,21
5233,jaime, m,jaime, Then what are you raving about?,3,1,6
5234,jaime, m,jaime, We'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming. We'll say whatever we like. I think we can outfox a 10-year-old.,3,1,22
5235,jaime, m,jaime, Never.,3,1,1
5236,jaime, m,jaime," The boy won't talk. And if he does, I'll kill him. Him, Ned Stark, the King... the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world.",3,1,34
5237,jaime, m,jaime, One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood.,3,1,7
5238,jaime, m,jaime, You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte. Best move I ever saw.,3,1,13
5239,jaime, m,jaime," I cut his head off, so no.",3,1,7
5240,jaime, m,jaime," He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours... ""Burn them all."" If that's all, your Grace...",3,1,18
5241,jaime, m,jaime, Little brother.,2,1,2
5242,jaime, m,jaime, Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black.,2,1,9
5243,jaime, m,jaime," Even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque. Give me a good clean death any day.",2,1,19
5244,jaime, m,jaime," My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on.",2,1,14
5245,jaime, m,jaime, A sword for the wall?,2,1,5
5246,jaime, m,jaime, Good man. Have you swung it yet?,2,1,7
5247,jaime, m,jaime,"  At someone, I mean. It's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man. You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing. Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall... Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot. We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us.",2,1,67
5248,jaime, m,jaime," Is it ""we"" already? Have you taken your vows then?",2,1,10
5249,jaime, m,jaime," Give my regards to the Night's Watch. I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force. And if not, It's only for life.",2,1,27
5250,jaime, m,jaime," There was nothing to be afraid of until you told father. [In a whisper, mimicking] We’re Lannisters. Lannisters don’t act like fools.",1,1,22
5251,jaime, m,jaime, But who would he tell?,1,1,5
5252,jaime, m,jaime," If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now. Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn’t know, it died with him. And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while he’s off fucking boars and hunting whores. Or is it the other way around? And life will go on.",1,1,63
5253,jaime, m,jaime," That’s an honor I can do without. Their days are too long, their lives are too short.",1,1,17
5254,jaime, m,jaime, Don’t get up.,1,1,3
5255,jaime, m,jaime," You’ve much to teach me, no doubt. But our sister craves your attention.",1,1,13
5256,jaime, m,jaime," A family trait. Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown. Don’t leave me alone with these people.",1,1,18
5257,jaime, m,jaime," I thought you might say that. But since we’re short on time, (he opens the door; a bevy of whores enter and descend on TYRION) Come on, girls. See you at sundown.",1,1,32
5258,jaime, m,jaime, I hear we might be neighbors soon. I hope it’s true.,1,1,11
5259,jaime, m,jaime," I’m sure we’ll have a tournament to celebrate the new title, if you accept. It would be good to have you in the field. The competition has become a bit stale.",1,1,31
5260,jaime, m,jaime, No? Getting a little old for it?,1,1,7
5261,jaime, m,jaime, Well said.,1,1,2
5262,jaime, m,jaime, Are you completely mad?,1,1,4
5263,jaime, m,jaime, It’s all right. It’s all right.,1,1,6
5264,jaime, m,jaime," I heard you the first time. (To BRAN) Quite the little climber, aren’t you? How old are you, boy?",1,1,19
5265,jaime, m,jaime, Ten.,1,1,1
5266,jaime, m,jaime, The things I do for love.,1,1,6
5267,jaime, m,jaime, Such a small pack of wolves.,5,1,6
5268,jaime, m,jaime, Was!... the Hand of the King. Now I'm not sure what he is... Lord of somewhere very far away.,5,1,19
5269,jaime, m,jaime," Get back inside where it's safe. I'm looking for my brother. You remember my brother, don't you, Lord Stark? Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man.",5,1,25
5270,jaime, m,jaime," It seems he had some trouble on the road. You wouldn't know what happened to him, would you?",5,1,18
5271,jaime, m,jaime," Come, Stark. I'd rather you die sword in hand.",5,1,9
5272,jaime, m,jaime," Threaten? As in, ""I'm going to open your Lord from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of”?",5,1,20
5273,jaime, m,jaime, You're right. Take him alive! Kill his men!,5,1,8
5274,jaime, m,jaime," My brother, Lord Stark... We want him back.",5,1,8
5275,jaime, m,jaime, Listen. Do you hear them? How many do you think are in there with him? Guess.,4,1,16
5276,jaime, m,jaime,  He likes to do this when I'm on duty... He makes me listen as he insults my sister.,4,1,18
5277,jaime, m,jaime, Why do I have to forgive you? Have you wronged me?,4,1,11
5278,jaime, m,jaime,"  Have we? Strange, I've forgotten.",4,1,5
5279,jaime, m,jaime, That's where you got your scar?,4,1,6
5280,jaime, m,jaime,  Vicious sons of whores.,4,1,4
5281,jaime, m,jaime, They stopped liking it at the end. That was a proper battle. D'you remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?,4,1,21
5282,jaime, m,jaime,  I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell. It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop.,4,1,19
5283,jaime, m,jaime,  I doubt it.,4,1,3
5284,jaime, m,jaime, I don't serve Lord Stark.,4,1,5
5285,jaime, m,jaime,"  ""Summoned to court to answer for the crimes of your bannerman Gregor Clegane, the Mountain""",7,1,15
5286,jaime, m,jaime,  Catelyn Stark took my brother.,7,1,5
5287,jaime, m,jaime,  Tyrion?,7,1,1
5288,jaime, m,jaime,"  One of our men interfered, speared him through the leg before I could finish him.",7,1,15
5289,jaime, m,jaime,  It wouldn't have been clean.,7,1,5
5290,jaime, m,jaime,  I could care less what anyone thinks of me.,7,1,9
5291,jaime, m,jaime,  It's the truth.,7,1,3
5292,jaime, m,jaime,  Of course it bothers me.,7,1,5
5293,jaime, m,jaime,  I didn't realize you placed such a high value on my brother's life.,7,1,13
5294,jaime, m,jaime,  So the lion does concern himself with the opinions of..,7,1,10
5295,jaime, m,jaime, I never thought you’d find her. I just assumed Sansa was dead.,8,6,12
5296,jaime, m,jaime," In my experience, girls like her don’t live very long.",8,6,10
5297,jaime, m,jaime," Well, I’m proud of you. I am. You fulfilled your oath to Catelyn Stark against all odds.",8,6,17
5298,jaime, m,jaime," Of course my sister wants Sansa dead. The girl is still a suspect in Joffrey’s murder, so there is that complication. What the hell are you doing here?",8,6,28
5299,jaime, m,jaime, You’re welcome to have him.,8,6,5
5300,jaime, m,jaime, With what army does she plan on taking Winterfell?,8,6,9
5301,jaime, m,jaime," They’re a bit occupied at the moment. I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun currently defended by the Tully rebels, so you can see the conundrum.",8,6,26
5302,jaime, m,jaime, Riverrun was granted to the Freys by royal decree.,8,6,9
5303,jaime, m,jaime, Exactly.,8,6,1
5304,jaime, m,jaime, We shouldn’t argue about politics.,8,6,5
5305,jaime, m,jaime, I’m a Lannister. Don’t ask me to betray my own house.,8,6,11
5306,jaime, m,jaime, What do you propose?,8,6,4
5307,jaime, m,jaime, Why would he abandon his ancestral home?,8,6,7
5308,jaime, m,jaime, Have you ever met the Blackfish?,8,6,6
5309,jaime, m,jaime, He’s even more stubborn than you are.,8,6,7
5310,jaime, m,jaime," All right. Try to talk some sense into the old goat. He won’t listen, but his men might. Not everybody wants to die for someone else’s home.",8,6,27
5311,jaime, m,jaime, You have my word. You have until nightfall.,8,6,8
5312,jaime, m,jaime, It’s yours. It will always be yours.,8,6,7
5313,jaime, m,jaime," Yes, Lady Brienne?",8,6,3
5314,jaime, m,jaime, Of course it does.,8,6,4
5315,jaime, m,jaime, Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.,8,6,7
5316,jaime, m,jaime, Lord Edmure.,8,6,2
5317,jaime, m,jaime, I apologize for the way the Freys treated you. A man of your birth deserved better. You have my word you’ll be properly fed and clothes from now on.,8,6,29
5318,jaime, m,jaime," The Blackfish is an old man. A good death is all he can hope for. But you, you have a child now, I’ve heard. A son you sired on your wedding night. You’re a potent man.",8,6,36
5319,jaime, m,jaime," You should be with them both. I can arrange that, you realize? Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock. A tutor for your boy, knights to train him to fight and to ride. And when he comes of age, he’ll have a keep of his own.",8,6,46
5320,jaime, m,jaime," I’ll remind you that our houses are at war. I’m sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you, but rebelling against the Crown does have consequences.",8,6,25
5321,jaime, m,jaime, Did I give you the impression that this was a negotiation? It’s not.,8,6,13
5322,jaime, m,jaime, I’ll leave the judgments to the gods.,8,6,7
5323,jaime, m,jaime, I was your sister’s prisoner once. She hit me on the head with a rock if I remember correctly.,8,6,19
5324,jaime, m,jaime," Perhaps, but she didn’t. Catelyn Stark hated me just like you hate me. But I didn’t hate her. I admired her. Far more than her husband or her son.",8,6,29
5325,jaime, m,jaime," No, I don’t, but I’m telling you anyway because you’re my prisoner. You don’t have a choice. The love she had for her children, I was a little awed by it. Reminded me of my sister.",8,6,36
5326,jaime, m,jaime, I’ll talk about whomever I want.,8,6,6
5327,jaime, m,jaime," She loved her children. I suppose all mothers do, but Catelyn and Cersei, there’s a fierceness you don’t often see.",8,6,20
5328,jaime, m,jaime, They’d do anything to protect their babies.,8,6,7
5329,jaime, m,jaime, Start a war. Burn cities to ash. Free their worst enemies. The things we do for love.,8,6,17
5330,jaime, m,jaime," That’s exactly why I came here. I love Cersei. You can laugh at that if you want. You can sneer. It doesn’t matter. She needs me. And to get back to her, I have to take Riverrun. I’ll send for your baby boy.",8,6,43
5331,jaime, m,jaime," And I’ll launch him into Riverrun with a catapult. Because you don’t matter to me, Lord Edmure. Your son doesn’t matter to me. The people in the castle don’t matter to me. Only Cersei. And if I have to slaughter every Tully who ever lived to get back to her, that’s what I’ll do.",8,6,54
5332,jaime, m,jaime, Good. Bring him to me.,8,6,5
5333,jaime, m,jaime, You’re welcome to her.,10,6,4
5334,jaime, m,jaime, Those two have their eyes on you.,10,6,7
5335,jaime, m,jaime, Not my type.,10,6,3
5336,jaime, m,jaime," Ladies, have you met Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay.",10,6,16
5337,jaime, m,jaime, There you go.,10,6,3
5338,jaime, m,jaime, I’m sure he would be.,10,6,5
5339,jaime, m,jaime," Have you done much fighting yourself, Lord Frey?",10,6,8
5340,jaime, m,jaime," No, but back in your day.",10,6,6
5341,jaime, m,jaime," Yes, you’re a great conqueror.",10,6,5
5342,jaime, m,jaime," They don’t fear the Freys, though. They fear the Lannisters. We gave you the Riverlands to hold the Riverlands. If we have to ride north and take them back for you every time you lose them, why do we need you?",10,6,41
5343,jaime, m,jaime, Come on.,10,6,2
5344,jaime, m,jaime, What did you do to him exactly? I haven't been able to get a clear answer.,3,6,16
5345,jaime, m,jaime," Does he understand what we’re saying? I mean, to the extent that he ever understood complete sentences in the first place.",3,6,21
5346,jaime, m,jaime, So tell him to march into the sept and crush the High Sparrow’s head like a melon.,3,6,17
5347,jaime, m,jaime, Has the Faith leveled official charges yet?,3,6,7
5348,jaime, m,jaime, That is one trial by combat I look forward to watching.,3,6,11
5349,jaime, m,jaime, I’m Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard does have a position on the Small Council.,3,6,20
5350,jaime, m,jaime, The same women who murdered Myrcella have overthrown House Martell and taken control of Dorne. We've got a lot to discuss. All of us together.,3,6,25
5351,jaime, m,jaime, Almost.,2,6,1
5352,jaime, m,jaime, Your mother wouldn’t do that.,2,6,5
5353,jaime, m,jaime, Are you angry with her?,2,6,5
5354,jaime, m,jaime, Then why didn’t you let her come? She has every right to be here.,2,6,14
5355,jaime, m,jaime," They’re not putting your mother in a cell ever again. Not while I’m here. Why haven’t you gone to see her? Everything she endured, she did it for you.",2,6,29
5356,jaime, m,jaime, Why not?,2,6,2
5357,jaime, m,jaime, We all fail sometimes.,2,6,4
5358,jaime, m,jaime, Go and see your mother and ask her to forgive you.,2,6,11
5359,jaime, m,jaime," Go and see your mother, Tommen.",2,6,6
5360,jaime, m,jaime, You’re a bold man.,2,6,4
5361,jaime, m,jaime, You must long for the next life.,2,6,7
5362,jaime, m,jaime, You imprisoned and humiliated my sister.,2,6,6
5363,jaime, m,jaime, What about my sins?,2,6,4
5364,jaime, m,jaime," I broke a sacred oath and stabbed my king in the back. I killed my own cousin. When the gods judged my brother guilty, I helped him escape their justice. What atonement do I deserve?",2,6,35
5365,jaime, m,jaime," Oh, the gods won’t mind. They’ve spilled more blood than the rest of us combined.",2,6,15
5366,jaime, m,jaime, They should be closer if you mean for them to save you.,2,6,12
5367,jaime, m,jaime, I’ve fought against worse odds.,2,6,5
5368,jaime, m,jaime, Mother.,1,6,1
5369,jaime, m,jaime," Shh, shh. Don’t think about it.",1,6,6
5370,jaime, m,jaime, She’s not suffering. She’s gone. No one can hurt her anymore.,1,6,11
5371,jaime, m,jaime, I know.,1,6,2
5372,jaime, m,jaime, You don’t believe that.,1,6,4
5373,jaime, m,jaime," Fuck prophecy. Fuck fate. Fuck everyone who isn’t us. We’re the only ones who matter, the only ones in this world. And everything they’ve taken from us, we’re going to take back and more.",1,6,34
5374,jaime, m,jaime, We’re going to take everything there is.,1,6,7
5375,jaime, m,jaime, Cersei is the mother of the king. She has the king’s ear and his trust. And the king has been speaking regularly with the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.,4,6,32
5376,jaime, m,jaime," You’ve got the second largest army in Westeros. You'll bring them into the city, stop queen Margaery’s humiliation before it starts, and take her back into Crown custody.",4,6,28
5377,jaime, m,jaime,"  You’ll take no action at all. When the Tyrell armies come, you will stand down. Are you expressly forbidden from standing down?",4,6,22
5378,jaime, m,jaime,"  The whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything. When the High Sparrow is in custody or dead, preferably, and Margaery's back at Tommen’s side, do you think the king will be angry at the outcome?",4,6,42
5379,jaime, m,jaime, My lord.,6,6,2
5380,jaime, m,jaime, Sorry to interrupt. We’re here for Queen Margaery and Ser Loras Tyrell. Give them to us and we’ll be on our way.,6,6,22
5381,jaime, m,jaime," I speak for King Tommen of House Baratheon, First of His Name.",6,6,12
5382,jaime, m,jaime, You already insulted one great house. It won’t happen twice. Every last sparrow will die before Margaery walks down that street.,6,6,21
5383,jaime, m,jaime, I’ve been a member of the Kingsguard since before you were born. You don’t have to do this. You don’t have to do anything.,6,6,24
5384,jaime, m,jaime, Not when you’re sitting in that chair.,6,6,7
5385,jaime, m,jaime, Will I be walking naked in the streets? Or will I spend a few months in the sept dungeons first to teach me about the gods’ mercy?,6,6,27
5386,jaime, m,jaime, I’m being sent to deal with the Blackfish. Apparently Walder Frey can’t manage it on his own because he’s 400 years old. Sent me with an army to the Riverlands and a siege that could last months.,6,6,37
5387,jaime, m,jaime, I’m not going to the Riverlands.,6,6,6
5388,jaime, m,jaime, I’m going to give Bronn the largest bag of gold anyone’s ever seen and have him gather the best killers he knows. I’ll take them to the sept and I’ll remove the High Sparrow’s head and every other sparrow head I can find.,6,6,43
5389,jaime, m,jaime, He has our son! He stole our son! He’s torn our family apart. How should we treat people who tear us apart?,6,6,22
5390,jaime, m,jaime, You’ll stand trial soon. I need to he here for you.,6,6,11
5391,jaime, m,jaime, Someone certainly does.,7,6,3
5392,jaime, m,jaime, You’re an anointed knight. There’s quite a difference.,7,6,8
5393,jaime, m,jaime, You have better instincts than any officer in the Lannister army.,7,6,11
5394,jaime, m,jaime, I expect to command all the Lannister forces before long. You can be the right hand I lost.,7,6,18
5395,jaime, m,jaime," Lothar, is it?",7,6,3
5396,jaime, m,jaime," ‘Cause you didn’t set up a proper perimeter. You just allowed 8,000 men to approach unchallenged.",7,6,16
5397,jaime, m,jaime, Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.,7,6,6
5398,jaime, m,jaime," Only a fool makes threats he’s not prepared to carry out. Now let’s say I threatened to hit you unless you shut your mouth, but you kept talking. What do you think I’d do?",7,6,34
5399,jaime, m,jaime, I’m here by the king’s command to take back this castle. Have him bathed and fed. Unless you’d like to take his place.,7,6,23
5400,jaime, m,jaime," The siege is now under my command. The next time the Blackfish looks out from those ramparts, he’ll see an army at his gates, not whatever this is.",7,6,28
5401,jaime, m,jaime," As I said, the siege is under my command. If that’s not to your liking, go home.",7,6,17
5402,jaime, m,jaime, Get word to the Blackfish. I want a parley.,7,6,9
5403,jaime, m,jaime, He’s an old man.,7,6,4
5404,jaime, m,jaime, Blackfish.,7,6,1
5405,jaime, m,jaime, I don’t have them.,7,6,4
5406,jaime, m,jaime, It won’t stop with Edmure. You’ll force me to storm the castle. Hundreds will die.,7,6,15
5407,jaime, m,jaime," We’ll breach them and kill every last one of you. But if you surrender, I’ll spare the lives of your men. On my honor.",7,6,24
5408,jaime, m,jaime," The war is over, ser. Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause?",7,6,13
5409,jaime, m,jaime, You clearly have no intention of saving your men’s lives. Why did you come to treat with me?,7,6,18
5410,jaime, m,jaime," Well, now you have.",7,6,4
5411,jaqen, m,jaqen, And?,9,5,1
5412,jaqen, m,jaqen, Perhaps that’s why the man is thin.,9,5,7
5413,jaqen, m,jaqen, Tomorrow.,9,5,1
5414,jaqen, m,jaqen, A girl has work to do.,9,5,6
5415,jaqen, m,jaqen, Lana is very impressive. Very industrious. She will make a fine servant for the Many Faced God.,8,5,17
5416,jaqen, m,jaqen, She will no longer turn left onto Ragman Lane. She will turn right and go to Ragman Harbor.,8,5,18
5417,jaqen, m,jaqen, She will see.,8,5,3
5418,jaqen, m,jaqen," How can a man tell a girl this. If he knew what she would see, there would be no reason to send her.",8,5,23
5419,jaqen, m,jaqen, The man is a gambler. He wages that his sailor's ship will make it to its destination. It is a strange wager for the captain. He only wins if he loses his life.,8,5,33
5420,jaqen, m,jaqen, A girl tells a man that she has seen.,8,5,9
5421,jaqen, m,jaqen," But perhaps the gambler loses his bet and decides that he doesn’t have to pay after all. A destitute woman and her small child, what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself? To whom can they turn for recourse?",8,5,46
5422,jaqen, m,jaqen, A man had no idea what she would see and what she would not. A girl named Lana will return to the docks. She will watch the gambler. She will come to know as much about him as she knows about herself.,8,5,42
5423,jaqen, m,jaqen, A gift for the Thin Man.,8,5,6
5424,jaqen, m,jaqen," Perhaps she is, perhaps she’s not.",8,5,6
5425,jaqen, m,jaqen, It is all the same to the Many Faced God.,8,5,10
5426,jaqen, m,jaqen, A girl has taken a life. The wrong life.,10,5,9
5427,jaqen, m,jaqen, You were.,10,5,2
5428,jaqen, m,jaqen, That man’s life wasn’t yours to take. A girl stole from the Many Faced God. Now a debt is owed.,10,5,20
5429,jaqen, m,jaqen, Only death can pay for life.,10,5,6
5430,jaqen, m,jaqen, He was no one.,10,5,4
5431,jaqen, m,jaqen, No one at all. Just as a girl should have been before she took a face from the hall.,10,5,19
5432,jaqen, m,jaqen, The faces are for no one.,10,5,6
5433,jaqen, m,jaqen, You are still someone.,10,5,4
5434,jaqen, m,jaqen, And to someone…,10,5,3
5435,jaqen, m,jaqen, ...the faces are as good as poison.,10,5,7
5436,jaqen, m,jaqen, Valar dohaeris.,3,5,2
5437,jaqen, m,jaqen, Good.,3,5,1
5438,jaqen, m,jaqen," No? Why come, then?",3,5,4
5439,jaqen, m,jaqen," A man teaches a girl. (Stands up). Valar dohaeris. All men must serve. Faceless men, most of all. (Walks away).",3,5,20
5440,jaqen, m,jaqen," A girl wants to serve herself. Here we serve the Many-Faced God, to serve well. A girl must become no-one.",3,5,20
5441,jaqen, m,jaqen, There is only one god. A girl knows his name. And all men know his gift.,3,5,16
5442,jaqen, m,jaqen, What are you doing?,3,5,4
5443,jaqen, m,jaqen, A girl is not ready.,3,5,5
5444,jaqen, m,jaqen, For what? For whatever you want. To be a Faceless Man. To be no one.,3,5,15
5445,jaqen, m,jaqen," Whose sword is that? It belongs to Arya Stark. Arya Stark's sword, Arya Stark's clothes, Arya Stark's stolen silver. A man wonders how is it that no one came to be surrounded by Arya Stark's things?",3,5,36
5446,jaqen, m,jaqen, There isn't. A man is not Jaqen H'ghar.,2,5,8
5447,jaqen, m,jaqen, No one. And that is who a girl must become.,2,5,10
5448,jaqen, m,jaqen, Who are you?,6,5,3
5449,jaqen, m,jaqen, Who are you?,6,5,3
5450,jaqen, m,jaqen, And where did you come from?,6,5,6
5451,jaqen, m,jaqen, A lie.,6,5,2
5452,jaqen, m,jaqen, A lie.,6,5,2
5453,jaqen, m,jaqen, A lie.,6,5,2
5454,jaqen, m,jaqen, The girl lies. To me. To the Many Faced God. To herself. Does she truly want to be no one?,6,5,20
5455,jaqen, m,jaqen, We never stop playing.,6,5,4
5456,jaqen, m,jaqen," Is the girl ready to give up her ears, her nose, her tongue, her hopes and dreams, her loves and hates, all that makes a girl who she is, forever?",6,5,30
5457,jaqen, m,jaqen, No. The girl is not ready to become no one. But she is ready to become someone else.,6,5,18
5458,jaqen, m,jaqen, A man has patrol duty.,8,2,5
5459,jaqen, m,jaqen, A girl owes one more name. The Red God demands it. Give the man a name.,8,2,16
5460,jaqen, m,jaqen," A minute, an hour, a month. Death is certain, the time is not.",8,2,13
5461,jaqen, m,jaqen, This a man cannot do.,8,2,5
5462,jaqen, m,jaqen," Help was not promised, lovely girl. Only death. There must be others. Give a name, any name.",8,2,17
5463,jaqen, m,jaqen," By the Seven New Gods and the Old Gods beyond counting, I swear it.",8,2,14
5464,jaqen, m,jaqen, A girl gives a man his own name?,8,2,8
5465,jaqen, m,jaqen,  Gods are not mocked. This is no joking thing.,8,2,9
5466,jaqen, m,jaqen,  Un-name me.,8,2,2
5467,jaqen, m,jaqen,  Please?,8,2,1
5468,jaqen, m,jaqen,  Thank you.,8,2,2
5469,jaqen, m,jaqen, This would require more than one life. This is not part of our bargain.,8,2,14
5470,jaqen, m,jaqen," A girl lacks honor. If I do this thing, a girl must obey.",8,2,13
5471,jaqen, m,jaqen, A girl and her friends will walk through the gate at midnight.,8,2,12
5472,jaqen, m,jaqen, Waiting for you.,10,2,3
5473,jaqen, m,jaqen," After all the things you have seen, this is your question?",10,2,11
5474,jaqen, m,jaqen," No harder than taking a new name, if you know the way. Show me how. I want to be able to do it, too.",10,2,24
5475,jaqen, m,jaqen," If you would learn, you must come with me.",10,2,9
5476,jaqen, m,jaqen, Far and away across the Narrow Sea to Braavos.,10,2,9
5477,jaqen, m,jaqen," To be a dancing master is a special thing, but to be a faceless man, that is something else entirely. The girl has many names on her lips. Joffrey, Cersei, Tywin Lannister, llyn Payne, the Hound. Names to offer up to the Red God. She could offer them all one by one.",10,2,52
5478,jaqen, m,jaqen, Then we must part. A man has duties as well. Here.,10,2,11
5479,jaqen, m,jaqen, A coin of great value.,10,2,5
5480,jaqen, m,jaqen, It is not meant for the buying of horses.,10,2,9
5481,jaqen, m,jaqen," If the day comes when you must find me again, just give that coin to any man from Braavos and say these words to him, ""Valar Morghulis.""",10,2,27
5482,jaqen, m,jaqen, Jaqen is dead. Say it again. Valar Morghulis.,10,2,8
5483,jaqen, m,jaqen, Good.,10,2,1
5484,jaqen, m,jaqen," Farewell, Arya Stark.",10,2,3
5485,jaqen, m,jaqen," Come back here! Help us, boy! A man can fight! Free us!",3,2,12
5486,jaqen, m,jaqen," Quick, give it to me. Give me the ax. Give me that.",3,2,12
5487,jaqen, m,jaqen, (Whispers) Boy.,2,2,2
5488,jaqen, m,jaqen, (Whispers) Lovely boy.,2,2,3
5489,jaqen, m,jaqen, A man has a thirst. The man does not drink for a day and a night. A boy could make a friend.,2,2,22
5490,jaqen, m,jaqen," A man does not choose his companions. These two, they have no courtesy. A man must ask forgiveness. (Pause). You're called Arry. (Arya nods).  This man has the honor to be Jaqen H'ghar. Once of the Free City of Lorath.",2,2,40
5491,jaqen, m,jaqen, (Quietly) The boy has more courage than sense.,2,2,8
5492,jaqen, m,jaqen, A girl says nothing.,5,2,4
5493,jaqen, m,jaqen," A girl keeps her mouth closed. No one hears, and friends may talk in secret, yes? A boy becomes a girl.",5,2,21
5494,jaqen, m,jaqen, And I was always aware. But the girl keeps secrets. It is not for a man to spoil them.,5,2,19
5495,jaqen, m,jaqen, And you fetch water for one of them now. Why is this right for you and wrong for me?,5,2,19
5496,jaqen, m,jaqen, You did. I did. And here we are.,5,2,8
5497,jaqen, m,jaqen, A man pays his debts. A man owes three.,5,2,9
5498,jaqen, m,jaqen," The Red God takes what is his, lovely girl. And only death may pay for life. You saved me and the two I was with. You stole three deaths from the Red God. We have to give them back. Speak three names and the man will do the rest. Three lives I will give you, no more, no less, and we're done.",5,2,62
5499,jaqen, m,jaqen, A man has said.,5,2,4
5500,jaqen, m,jaqen, A man needs a name.,5,2,5
5501,jaqen, m,jaqen," That is enough. Go now, girl. Your master is thirsty.",5,2,10
5502,jaqen, m,jaqen, A girl has named a second name. A man will do what must be done.,6,2,15
5503,jaqen, m,jaqen, A girl cannot tell a man when exactly he must do a thing. A man cannot make a thing happen before its time.,6,2,23
5504,jaqen, m,jaqen, (sighs),6,2,1
5505,jaqen, m,jaqen, Yes. But here you are. And there she is.,8,6,9
5506,jaqen, m,jaqen, Finally a girl is no one.,8,6,6
5507,jaqen, m,jaqen," If a girl tells me her name, I will give her eyes back.",3,6,13
5508,jaqen, m,jaqen, Come.,3,6,1
5509,jaqen, m,jaqen," If a girl is truly no one, she has nothing to fear.",3,6,12
5510,jaqen, m,jaqen, Who are you?,3,6,3
5511,jaqen, m,jaqen, Who are you?,2,6,3
5512,jaqen, m,jaqen," If a girl says her name, a man will let her sleep under a roof tonight.",2,6,16
5513,jaqen, m,jaqen," If a girl says her name, a man will feed her tonight.",2,6,12
5514,jaqen, m,jaqen," If a girl says her name, a man will give her eyes back.",2,6,13
5515,jaqen, m,jaqen, Come.,2,6,1
5516,jaqen, m,jaqen, Leave it. A girl is not a beggar anymore.,2,6,9
5517,jaqen, m,jaqen, She has a point.,5,6,4
5518,jaqen, m,jaqen, None of the first Faceless Men were born to lords and ladies. They began as slaves in the mines of Valyria.,5,6,21
5519,jaqen, m,jaqen," He was no one. The Many-Faced God taught him how to shed his face and how to give the gift. The man taught others in exchange for their service. Many served, many more gifts were given. Soon all the masters and overseers were gone and the Faceless Men fled.",5,6,49
5520,jaqen, m,jaqen," Here. They founded the Free City of Braavos and built this house. These were the faces they wore in life when they were not wearing others. The first Faceless Men. And now a girl is one of them, if a girl desires.",5,6,42
5521,jaqen, m,jaqen," An actress who calls herself Lady Crane. She performs at the theater in Sheelba Square. A girl has been given a second chance. There will not be a third. One way or another, a face will be added to the hall.",5,6,41
5522,jaqen, m,jaqen, A girl is not ready.,5,6,5
5523,jaqen, m,jaqen, So a man has heard.,5,6,5
5524,jaqen, m,jaqen, Does death only come for the wicked and leave the decent behind?,5,6,12
5525,jaqen, m,jaqen, That does not matter. The price was paid.,5,6,8
5526,jaqen, m,jaqen, A girl must decide if she wants to serve the Many-Faced God.,5,6,12
5527,jaqen, m,jaqen, A servant does not ask questions.,5,6,6
5528,jaqen, m,jaqen, And?,6,6,1
5529,jaqen, m,jaqen, A shame. A girl had many gifts.,6,6,7
5530,jaqen, m,jaqen, Don’t let her suffer.,6,6,4
5531,tywin, m,tywin, You seem rather drunk.,8,3,4
5532,tywin, m,tywin,"  This isn't about your wedding. Renly Baratheon had a wedding. Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible.",8,3,22
5533,tywin, m,tywin,"  If you're going to give her one, you need to perform.",8,3,11
5534,tywin, m,tywin, More than once.,8,3,3

5536,tywin, m,tywin,"  I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace. I'm sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the king.",8,3,20

5541,tywin, m,tywin, Not you.,10,3,2
5542,tywin, m,tywin, You're a fool if you believe he's the most powerful man in Westeros.,10,3,13
5543,tywin, m,tywin, You really think a crown gives you power?,10,3,8
5544,tywin, m,tywin, Mm-hmm.,10,3,1
5545,tywin, m,tywin, Mm-hmm.,10,3,1
5546,tywin, m,tywin, Which he got from me. Do you disapprove?,10,3,8
5547,tywin, m,tywin," But to slaughter them at a wedding. Explain to me why it is more noble to kill 10,000 men in battle than a dozen at dinner.",10,3,26
5548,tywin, m,tywin," To end the war. To protect the family. Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks? Go ahead, write one. I'm in this world a little while longer to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood.",10,3,39
5549,tywin, m,tywin, Good. Let them remember what happens when they march on the south. All the Stark men are dead. Winterfell is a ruin. Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North until your son by Sansa comes of age.,10,3,39
5550,tywin, m,tywin, I believe you still have some work to do on that score.,10,3,12
5551,tywin, m,tywin," One way or another, you will get that girl pregnant.",10,3,10
5552,tywin, m,tywin, Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works?,10,3,13
5553,tywin, m,tywin, The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first. A good man does everything in his power to better his family's position regardless of his own selfish desires.,10,3,42
5554,tywin, m,tywin, Does that amuse you?,10,3,4
5555,tywin, m,tywin," Easy for me, is it?",10,3,5
5556,tywin, m,tywin," The day that you were born. I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away. Instead, I let you live. And I brought you as my son. Because you're a Lannister.",10,3,37
5557,tywin, m,tywin, What news of Jaime?,3,3,4
5558,tywin, m,tywin," 20,000 unwashed northerns have known about his escape for weeks. Collectively, you control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined. Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is?",3,3,41
5559,tywin, m,tywin,"  Try harder. What do we have, then?",3,3,7
5560,tywin, m,tywin,"  Well, let him have it. The name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble. The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.",3,3,31
5561,tywin, m,tywin, You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold. Then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him.,3,3,37
5562,tywin, m,tywin, Fully agreed. Which is why I'm naming you new Master of Coin.,3,3,12
5563,tywin, m,tywin,  It would appear to be a position that best suits your talents.,3,3,12
5564,tywin, m,tywin, Am I enjoying it?,1,3,4
5565,tywin, m,tywin, ( chuckles ) Yes. I heard how happy you were. ( blows ) You brought a whore into my bed.,1,3,20
5566,tywin, m,tywin," I sent you here to advise the king. I gave you real power and authority. You chose to spend your days as you always have, bedding harlots and drinking with thieves.",1,3,31
5567,tywin, m,tywin," What do you want, Tyrion?",1,3,5
5568,tywin, m,tywin, Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal.,1,3,9
5569,tywin, m,tywin," Jugglers and singers require applause. You are a Lannister. Do you think I demanded a garland of roses every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield? Hmm? Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open rebellion. So tell me what you want.",1,3,50
5570,tywin, m,tywin, You want Casterly Rock?,1,3,4
5571,tywin, m,tywin," ( sighs ) We'll find you accommodations more suited to your name and as a reward for your accomplishments during the battle of Blackwater Bay. And when the time is right, you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy. And if you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded with a suitable wife. And I would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock.",1,3,86
5572,tywin, m,tywin," Why? You ask that? You, who killed your mother to come into the world? You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning. Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine. And to teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him. But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse. Go, now. Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock. Go.",1,3,110
5573,tywin, m,tywin," Oh, one more thing. The next whore I catch in your bed I'll hang.",1,3,14
5574,tywin, m,tywin, You're late.,5,3,2
5575,tywin, m,tywin," Our business concerns her, too. Sit.",5,3,6
5576,tywin, m,tywin, Never mind that now. We have something important to discuss.,5,3,10
5577,tywin, m,tywin, Your sister has learned that your new friends the Tyrells are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.,5,3,19
5578,tywin, m,tywin, Your jokes are not appreciated.,5,3,5
5579,tywin, m,tywin," I bring them into the royal fold and this is how they repay me, by trying to steal the key to the North out from under me.",5,3,27
5580,tywin, m,tywin, The Karstarks have marched home. The young wolf has lost half his army. His days are numbered. Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers. That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell. And I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells.,5,3,43
5581,tywin, m,tywin, There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot. Plots are not public knowledge. And the Tyrells won't carry this one out until after Joffrey's wedding. We need to act first and kill this union in its crib.,5,3,37
5582,tywin, m,tywin, We find Sansa Stark a different husband.,5,3,7
5583,tywin, m,tywin, I can and I do.,5,3,5
5584,tywin, m,tywin," There, you see? You will wed her, bed her, and put a child in her. Surely you're capable of that.",5,3,20
5585,tywin, m,tywin, You wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle. Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for. And it is past time you were wed.,5,3,31
5586,tywin, m,tywin, Only too well.,5,3,3
5587,tywin, m,tywin, Tyrion will do as he's bid. As will you.,5,3,9
5588,tywin, m,tywin, You'll marry Ser Loras.,5,3,4
5589,tywin, m,tywin," The boy is heir to Highgarden. Tyrion will secure the North, you will secure the Reach.",5,3,16
5590,tywin, m,tywin," Yes, you will. You're still fertile. You need to marry again and breed.",5,3,13
5591,tywin, m,tywin, You're my daughter! You will do as I command and you will marry Loras Tyrell and put an end to the disgusting rumors about you once and for all.,5,3,29
5592,tywin, m,tywin, Not another word. My children. You've disgraced the Lannister name for far too long.,5,3,14
5593,tywin, m,tywin, You wanted to speak to me?,4,3,6
5594,tywin, m,tywin, What about him?,4,3,3
5595,tywin, m,tywin, When Catelyn Stark took Tyrion prisoner what did I do in response?,4,3,12
5596,tywin, m,tywin," And if I would start a war for that lecherous little stump, what do you think I am doing for my oldest son and heir?",4,3,25
5597,tywin, m,tywin, Whatever I can.,4,3,3
5598,tywin, m,tywin, You're still here.,4,3,3
5599,tywin, m,tywin, Why?,4,3,1
5600,tywin, m,tywin, All right. Contribute.,4,3,3
5601,tywin, m,tywin," The Tyrells helped us defeat Stannis Baratheon. The Tyrells saved your life, your children's lives.",4,3,15
5602,tywin, m,tywin, Good. I wish you knew how to manipulate him. I don't distrust you because you're a woman. I distrust you because you're not as smart as you think you are. You've allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you and everyone else in this city.,4,3,45
5603,tywin, m,tywin, I will.,4,3,2
5604,tywin, m,tywin, Why?,6,3,1
5605,tywin, m,tywin," Is rich, the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms and the mother of the king.",6,3,16
5606,tywin, m,tywin, Old?,6,3,1
5607,tywin, m,tywin," The years punish us as well, I promise you that. My stomach remains quite strong, however. The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandson's nocturnal activities. Do you deny them?",6,3,34
5608,tywin, m,tywin, And a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and remove the stain from his name.,6,3,28
5609,tywin, m,tywin, Of course.,6,3,2
5610,tywin, m,tywin, No.,6,3,1
5611,tywin, m,tywin, Never.,6,3,1
5612,tywin, m,tywin, Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior.,6,3,9
5613,tywin, m,tywin, I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it.,6,3,13
5614,tywin, m,tywin, I don't care what people believe. And neither do you.,6,3,10
5615,tywin, m,tywin," Now, if the rumors about my children were true, then Joffrey is no king at all and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt.",6,3,27
5616,tywin, m,tywin, The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable. All right. I'll remove it for you.,6,3,12
5617,tywin, m,tywin," If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei, I will name him to the Kingsguard. I'm sure you're familiar with the Kingsguard vows. He will never marry. He will never have children.",6,3,32
5618,tywin, m,tywin, The Tyrell name will fade. And Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery.,6,3,16
5619,tywin, m,tywin," I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously. So, shall I draw up the order? Or do you consent to this marriage?",6,3,29
5620,tywin, m,tywin, Your Grace.,7,3,2
5621,tywin, m,tywin, You wanted to speak to me?,7,3,6
5622,tywin, m,tywin," You're welcome to attend the meetings of your small council, Your Grace. Any or all of them.",7,3,17
5623,tywin, m,tywin, Of course.,7,3,2
5624,tywin, m,tywin," I have, yes.",7,3,3
5625,tywin, m,tywin,"  The Tower of the Hand is where I work. To walk from there to here would take time, time I could otherwise spend productively.",7,3,24
5626,tywin, m,tywin,  We could arrange to have you carried.,7,3,7
5627,tywin, m,tywin, Where did you hear about this?,7,3,6
5628,tywin, m,tywin, Apparently so.,7,3,2
5629,tywin, m,tywin,"  When I was Hand of the King under your father's predecessor, the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons were kept in this room. The skull of the last of them was right here. It was the size of an apple.",7,3,40
5630,tywin, m,tywin," Yes, and the creature to whom it belonged died 300 years ago. Curiosities on the far side of the world are no threat to us.",7,3,25
5631,tywin, m,tywin,  Because we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the realm by counseling the king on matters about which he knows nothing.,7,3,26
5632,tywin, m,tywin, You are being counseled at this very moment.,7,3,8
5633,tywin, m,tywin," From now on, I will see to it that you are appropriately consulted on important matters whenever necessary. Your Grace.",7,3,20
5634,tywin, m,tywin," Not another word. We've been over this, the matter's closed.",10,4,10
5635,tywin, m,tywin, You are betrothed to Loras Tyrell. Still betrothed to Loras Tyrell and you will marry Loras Tyrell as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.,10,4,23
5636,tywin, m,tywin," Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands. Tyrion's sentence will be carried out tomorrow. You have, on several occasions, made great claims about your commitment to this family's future. Your role in that future is more vital now than it ever was.",10,4,41
5637,tywin, m,tywin," When you were nine years old, I was called to the capital. I decided to take your brother with me and not you. You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances and if you recall-",10,4,41
5638,tywin, m,tywin, Do you think you'll be the first person dragged into a sept to be married against her will?,10,4,18
5639,tywin, m,tywin, No.,10,4,1
5640,tywin, m,tywin, And how will you do that?,10,4,6
5641,tywin, m,tywin, And what truth would that be?,10,4,6
5642,tywin, m,tywin, Known what?,10,4,2
5643,tywin, m,tywin," No, no, no, no, no.",10,4,5
5644,tywin, m,tywin, I don't believe you.,10,4,4
5645,tywin, m,tywin," Tyrion! Put down the crossbow. Who released you? Ah, your brother ,I expect. He always had a soft spot for you. Come, we’ll go and talk in my chambers. Is this how you want to speak to me? Shaming your father has always given you pleasure…",10,4,46
5646,tywin, m,tywin," Yes. But you refused to die. I respect that, even admire it. You fight for what’s yours. I’d never let them execute you; is that what you fear? I’d never let Illyn Payne take your head. You’re a Lannister. You’re my son.",10,4,42
5647,tywin, m,tywin, Who?,10,4,1
5648,tywin, m,tywin," Bah, Tyrion. Put down that crossbow.",10,4,6
5649,tywin, m,tywin, It doesn’t matter.,10,4,3
5650,tywin, m,tywin, She was a whore!,10,4,4
5651,tywin, m,tywin, And what? You’ll kill your own father in the privy? No. You’re my son. Enough of this nonsense…,10,4,18
5652,tywin, m,tywin, Enough. We’ll go back to my chambers and speak with some dignity.,10,4,12
5653,tywin, m,tywin," What, are you afraid of a dead whore?",10,4,8
5654,tywin, m,tywin, You shot me. You’re no son of mine.,10,4,8
5655,tywin, m,tywin, Find her. Bar the gates of the city. Seize every ship in the harbor.,3,4,14
5656,tywin, m,tywin, No one leaves the capital! No one!,3,4,7
5657,tywin, m,tywin, Your brother is dead. Do you know what that means?,3,4,10
5658,tywin, m,tywin, I'm not trying to trick you.,3,4,6
5659,tywin, m,tywin," Yes, you will become king. What kind of king do you think you'll be?",3,4,14
5660,tywin, m,tywin," Mm, I think so as well. You've got the right temperament for it. But what makes a good king? Hmm? What is a good king's single most important quality?",3,4,29
5661,tywin, m,tywin, Hmm. Baelor the Blessed was holy. And pious. He built this sept. He also named a six-year-old boy high septon because he thought the boy could work miracles. He ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful.,3,4,48
5662,tywin, m,tywin, Yeah. A good king must be just. Orys I was just. Everyone applauded his reforms. Nobles and commoners alike. But he wasn't just for long. He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother. Was that truly just of him? To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize?,3,4,60
5663,tywin, m,tywin, No.,3,4,1
5664,tywin, m,tywin," Yes. Strength. King Robert was strong. He won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty. And he attended three small council meetings in 17 years. He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him. So, we have a man who starves himself to death, a man who lets his own brother murder him, and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing. What do they all lack?",3,4,77
5665,tywin, m,tywin, Yes!,3,4,1
5666,tywin, m,tywin, Yes. But what is wisdom? Hmm? A house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong Navy that could one day oppose you. How do you know which choice is wise and which isn't? You've any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers?,3,4,54
5667,tywin, m,tywin," No. Of course not. A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't. You're young. A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age. And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards... Your brother was not a wise king. Your brother was not a good king. If he had been, perhaps he'd still be alive. Now, as the king, you will have to marry. Do you understand why?",3,4,81
5668,tywin, m,tywin," Yes, but why? To further the family line. Do you know how that happens?",3,4,14
5669,tywin, m,tywin," Yes, but has anyone explained the details to you?",3,4,9
5670,tywin, m,tywin,  Prince Oberyn.,3,4,2
5671,tywin, m,tywin, May we have the room?,3,4,5
5672,tywin, m,tywin," No, thank you.",3,4,3
5673,tywin, m,tywin," No, thank you.",3,4,3
5674,tywin, m,tywin, Are you?,3,4,2
5675,tywin, m,tywin, Which way is that?,3,4,4
5676,tywin, m,tywin, Some believe the king choked.,3,4,5
5677,tywin, m,tywin, I hear you studied poisons at the Citadel.,3,4,8
5678,tywin, m,tywin," Your hatred for my family is rather well known. You arrive at the capital, an expert in poisoning, some days later my grandson dies of poisoning.",3,4,26
5679,tywin, m,tywin, You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel on the day that you arrived. What did you discuss?,3,4,18
5680,tywin, m,tywin, What did you discuss?,3,4,4
5681,tywin, m,tywin, For which you blame me.,3,4,5
5682,tywin, m,tywin," Here I stand unarmed, unguarded. Should I be concerned?",3,4,9
5683,tywin, m,tywin, Men at war commit all kinds of crimes without their superiors' knowledge.,3,4,12
5684,tywin, m,tywin, Categorically.,3,4,1
5685,tywin, m,tywin, I'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you.,3,4,8
5686,tywin, m,tywin, I could arrange for this meeting.,3,4,6
5687,tywin, m,tywin," There will be a trial for my son. And as custom dictates, three judges will render a verdict. I will preside. Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge. I would like you to be the third.",3,4,37
5688,tywin, m,tywin," Not long ago, the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon. Declared themselves enemies of the throne. Now they are our strongest allies.",3,4,21
5689,tywin, m,tywin, I will also invite you to sit on the small council to serve as one of the new king's principal advisors.,3,4,21
5690,tywin, m,tywin," We are not the Seven Kingdoms until Dorne returns to the fold. The king is dead. The Greyjoys are in open rebellion. A wildling army marches on the Wall. And in the East, a Targaryen girl has three dragons. Before long, she will turn her eyes to Westeros. Only the Dornish managed to resist Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.",3,4,59
5691,tywin, m,tywin, We need each other. You help me serve justice to the king's assassins and I will help you serve justice to Elia's.,3,4,22
5692,tywin, m,tywin, Have her brought to the Tower of the Hand before the wedding.,2,4,12
5693,tywin, m,tywin," One of only two Valyrian steel swords in the capital, Your Grace, freshly forged in your honor.",2,4,17
5694,tywin, m,tywin," Bit much, wouldn't you say?",2,4,5
5695,tywin, m,tywin,  Proportionate to what?,2,4,3
5696,tywin, m,tywin, People who spend their money on this sort of nonsense tend not to have it for long.,2,4,17
5697,tywin, m,tywin, Shall we stick golden roses in half the meat pies to commemorate your generosity?,2,4,14
5698,tywin, m,tywin, I'm not worried about the Iron Bank.,2,4,7
5699,tywin, m,tywin, You're in rather a good mood.,2,4,6
5700,tywin, m,tywin, I won't ask why.,2,4,4
5701,tywin, m,tywin, Prince Oberyn.,2,4,2
5702,tywin, m,tywin, Charmed.,2,4,1
5703,tywin, m,tywin," Please give him our regards. With any luck, the gout will abate with time and he will be able to walk again.",2,4,22
5704,tywin, m,tywin, Noblemen in my part of the country don't enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in Dorne.,2,4,17
5705,tywin, m,tywin,  Mm-hmm.,1,4,1
5706,tywin, m,tywin, It is.,1,4,2
5707,tywin, m,tywin, There are three living smiths who know how to rework Valyrian steel. The finest of them was in Volantis. Came here to King's Landing at my invitation.,1,4,27
5708,tywin, m,tywin, From someone who no longer had need of it.,1,4,9
5709,tywin, m,tywin, And now we have two.,1,4,5
5710,tywin, m,tywin, The original weapon was absurdly large. Plenty of steel for two swords.,1,4,12
5711,tywin, m,tywin, You'll have to train your left hand.,1,4,7
5712,tywin, m,tywin, You'll never be as good.,1,4,5
5713,tywin, m,tywin, You can't serve in the Kingsguard with one hand.,1,4,9
5714,tywin, m,tywin,  The war is over. The king is safe. The king is never safe.,1,4,13
5715,tywin, m,tywin,  Other knights protected the king while you were a prisoner. They will continue to do so when you go home.,1,4,20
5716,tywin, m,tywin, You'll return to Casterly Rock and rule in my stead.,1,4,10
5717,tywin, m,tywin,  I am the King's Hand. My place is here. I don't expect to see the Rock again before I die.,1,4,20
5718,tywin, m,tywin,  You won't be breaking anything. There is a precedent to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties. The king will exercise that prerogative.,1,4,22
5719,tywin, m,tywin,  No?,1,4,1
5720,tywin, m,tywin, I don't believe I asked you a question.,1,4,8
5721,tywin, m,tywin,  If you think your bloody honor comes before...,1,4,8
5722,tywin, m,tywin,  What do you want?,1,4,4
5723,tywin, m,tywin," For 40 years I've tried to teach you. If you haven't learned by now, you never will. Go. If serving as a glorified bodyguard is the sum of your ambition, go serve.",1,4,32
5724,tywin, m,tywin,  Keep it.,1,4,2
5725,tywin, m,tywin, A one-handed man with no family needs all the help he can get.,1,4,13
5726,tywin, m,tywin, When will the wedding take place in your mind?,5,4,9
5727,tywin, m,tywin,  A fortnight?,5,4,2
5728,tywin, m,tywin," No jugglers, no jousting dwarves, no 77-course meals.",5,4,8
5729,tywin, m,tywin, And your wedding to Loras?,5,4,5
5730,tywin, m,tywin, Shortly?,5,4,1
5731,tywin, m,tywin, I know you don't like them. I didn't like your husband. Used to pat me on the back a lot. I didn't trust him.,5,4,24
5732,tywin, m,tywin, You don't need to make formal alliances with people you trust.,5,4,11
5733,tywin, m,tywin, Ourselves alone.,5,4,2
5734,tywin, m,tywin,  The Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources and we need them on our side.,5,4,18
5735,tywin, m,tywin, Robert had me funding him. Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.,5,4,14
5736,tywin, m,tywin, Do you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year?,5,4,14
5737,tywin, m,tywin,"  Go on, your best guess.",5,4,5
5738,tywin, m,tywin,  Doesn't matter. The answer is the same.,5,4,7
5739,tywin, m,tywin, Our last working mine ran dry three years ago.,5,4,9
5740,tywin, m,tywin, The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money.,5,4,13
5741,tywin, m,tywin, A tremendous amount.,5,4,3
5742,tywin, m,tywin, The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank. There is no someone.,5,4,11
5743,tywin, m,tywin," And a temple is comprised of stones. One stone crumbles and another takes its place. And the temple holds its form for 1,000 years or more. That's what the Iron Bank is... a temple. We all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it. You can't run from them. You can't cheat them. You can't sway them with excuses. If you owe them money and you don't want to crumble yourself, you pay it back. Vesting the Tyrells in the crown will help a great deal in this respect.",5,4,92
5744,tywin, m,tywin," I know you're building a strong case against Tyrion. And as a mother, that is your right. But as a judge, I cannot discuss the trial with you.",5,4,28
5745,tywin, m,tywin, The trial begins this afternoon. We only have the morning for affairs of state. Shall we begin?,6,4,17
5746,tywin, m,tywin, What would it take to make the common soldier stupid enough to try his luck with the Hound?,6,4,18
5747,tywin, m,tywin, Make it 100. What else?,6,4,5
5748,tywin, m,tywin, The Targaryen girl?,6,4,3
5749,tywin, m,tywin, Joffrey didn't die on his watch. Dismissing him was as insulting as it was stupid.,6,4,15
5750,tywin, m,tywin, Dragons haven't won a war in 300 years. Armies win them all the time. She must be dealt with.,6,4,19
5751,tywin, m,tywin," Eventually, if it comes to that. Can your little birds find their way into Meereen?",6,4,15
5752,tywin, m,tywin," Mmm. Lord Tyrell, be a good man. Fetch my quill and paper.",6,4,12
5753,tywin, m,tywin," Tyrion of the House Lannister, you stand accused by the Queen Regent of regicide. Did you kill King Joffrey?",6,4,19
5754,tywin, m,tywin," Did your wife, the Lady Sansa?",6,4,6
5755,tywin, m,tywin," How would you say he died, then?",6,4,7
5756,tywin, m,tywin, So you would blame the bakers?,6,4,6
5757,tywin, m,tywin, Silence.,6,4,1
5758,tywin, m,tywin," Silence! You will not speak unless called upon. You're dismissed, Ser Meryn.",6,4,12
5759,tywin, m,tywin, By whom?,6,4,2
5760,tywin, m,tywin," Grand Maester, you examined King Joffrey's corpse. Was it without question poison that killed him?",6,4,15
5761,tywin, m,tywin, Was this one of the poisons stolen from your store?,6,4,10
5762,tywin, m,tywin," Thank you, Your Grace, for the courage of your testimony.",6,4,10
5763,tywin, m,tywin, One.,6,4,1
5764,tywin, m,tywin, We will adjourn for now.,6,4,5
5765,tywin, m,tywin, Toll the bells in an hour's time.,6,4,7
5766,tywin, m,tywin, I've condemned no one. The trial is not over.,6,4,9
5767,tywin, m,tywin, I know nothing of the sort.,6,4,6
5768,tywin, m,tywin, He killed his king.,6,4,4
5769,tywin, m,tywin,  It won't be murder. It'll be justice.,6,4,7
5770,tywin, m,tywin," I'm performing my sworn duty as Hand of the King. If Tyrion is found guilty, he will be punished accordingly.",6,4,20
5771,tywin, m,tywin,"  No, he'll be punished accordingly.",6,4,5
5772,tywin, m,tywin, I'm well aware of your oath.,6,4,6
5773,tywin, m,tywin, What happens to my dynasty if I spare the life of my grandson's killer?,6,4,14
5774,tywin, m,tywin, Done.,6,4,1
5775,tywin, m,tywin," When the testimony's concluded and a guilty verdict rendered, Tyrion will be given the chance to speak. He'll plead for mercy. I'll allow him to join the Night's Watch. In three days' time, he'll depart for Castle Black and live out his days at the Wall. You'll remove your white cloak immediately. You will leave King's Landing to assume your rightful place at Casterly Rock. You will marry a suitable woman and father children named Lannister. And you'll never turn your back on your family again.",6,4,86
5776,tywin, m,tywin, And you have mine.,6,4,4
5777,tywin, m,tywin, The crown may call its next witness.,6,4,7
5778,tywin, m,tywin, State your name.,6,4,3
5779,tywin, m,tywin, Do you swear by all the gods that your testimony will be true and honest?,6,4,15
5780,tywin, m,tywin, Do you know this man?,6,4,5
5781,tywin, m,tywin, How do you know him?,6,4,5
5782,tywin, m,tywin, This man stands accused of murdering King Joffrey. What do you know of this?,6,4,14
5783,tywin, m,tywin, Silence! Continue.,6,4,2
5784,tywin, m,tywin, How did you come to be in his service?,6,4,9
5785,tywin, m,tywin, Silence. Silence!,6,4,2
5786,tywin, m,tywin, You wish to confess?,6,4,4
5787,tywin, m,tywin, Tyrion. Do you wish to confess?,6,4,6
5788,tywin, m,tywin, You admit you poisoned the king?,6,4,6
5789,tywin, m,tywin, You are not on trial for being a dwarf.,6,4,9
5790,tywin, m,tywin, Have you nothing to say in your defense?,6,4,8
5791,tywin, m,tywin, Ser Meryn. Ser Meryn. Escort the prisoner back to his cell.,6,4,11
5792,tywin, m,tywin, The battle is over. We have won.,9,2,7
5793,tywin, m,tywin, Surrender the Iron Throne?,8,2,4
5794,tywin, m,tywin," No, a king who runs will not be king for long. He's a Lannister. He'll stand and fight. Stannis, two days from the capital and the wolf at my doorstep.",8,2,30
5795,tywin, m,tywin," Ha! The last time the scouts assured us of Stark's movement, he lured us into a trap. Which is why my son is his prisoner.",8,2,25
5796,tywin, m,tywin, He's a boy and he's never lost a battle. He'll risk anything at any time because he doesn't know enough to be afraid.,8,2,23
5797,tywin, m,tywin," We'll ride at nightfall. I want a full night's march before he knows we're on the move. Clegane, you'll maintain a garrison here at Harrenhal. Track down this brotherhood and destroy them. The girl has proven herself a good servant. She'll stay on with you. See that he doesn't get drunk in the evenings. He's poor company when he's sober, but he's better at his work.",8,2,66
5798,tywin, m,tywin," Thank you, Your Grace.",10,2,4
5799,tywin, m,tywin, The Starks understand winter better than we ever will. The cold won't beat them.,5,2,14
5800,tywin, m,tywin," And I'm sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments, they would report growing discontent amongst the Southern lords. This is war, no one's content. We've underestimated the Stark boy for too long. He has a good mind for warfare, his men worship him. And as long as he keeps winning battles, they'll keep believing he is King in the North. You've been waiting for him to fail. He is not going to fail, not without our help. So how do we stop him?",5,2,86
5801,tywin, m,tywin," Yes, I think you would, Reginald. And because you're my cousin, I might even let you wake from that sleep. Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you.",5,2,28
5802,tywin, m,tywin," Well, then you'd better start riding. Go, before I change my mind and send her your head.",5,2,17
5803,tywin, m,tywin," If your name wasn't Lannister, you'd be scrubbing out pots in the cook's tent. Go!",5,2,15
5804,tywin, m,tywin," Not wine, water. We'll be here for some time. Girl, where are you from?",5,2,14
5805,tywin, m,tywin, And who are the Lords of Maidenpool? Remind me.,5,2,9
5806,tywin, m,tywin, And what is their sigil?,5,2,5
5807,tywin, m,tywin," A red salmon. I think a Maidenpool girl would remember that. You're a Northerner, aren't you?",5,2,16
5808,tywin, m,tywin," Good. One more time, where are you from?",5,2,8
5809,tywin, m,tywin, And what do they say of Robb Stark in the North?,5,2,11
5810,tywin, m,tywin, And?,5,2,1
5811,tywin, m,tywin, And do you believe them?,5,2,5
5812,tywin, m,tywin, Fetch that water.,5,2,3
5813,tywin, m,tywin, What's this?,4,2,2
5814,tywin, m,tywin, Evidently not. Why are these prisoners not in their cells?,4,2,10
5815,tywin, m,tywin, Are we so well-manned that we can afford to discard able young bodies and skilled laborers?,4,2,16
5816,tywin, m,tywin," You, do you have a trade?",4,2,6
5817,tywin, m,tywin," He'll do no such thing. This one's a girl, you idiot, dressed as a boy. Why?",4,2,16
5818,tywin, m,tywin, Smart. More than I can say for this lot. Get these prisoners to work. Bring the girl. I need a new cupbearer.,4,2,22
5819,tywin, m,tywin, Can you read?,6,2,3
5820,tywin, m,tywin, Can you read?,6,2,3
5821,tywin, m,tywin, This letter detailing our infantry movements was meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand. It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand.,6,2,23
5822,tywin, m,tywin," Girl, fetch me the History of the Greater and the Lesser Houses. It's the one on this",6,2,17
5823,tywin, m,tywin, My cupbearer can read better than you.,6,2,7
5824,tywin, m,tywin, To whom does House Dormand owe allegiance?,6,2,7
5825,tywin, m,tywin," To the Starks of Winterfell! Who have 20,000 men and my son! I judged you might be good for something more than brutalizing peasants. I see I overestimated you. If you ever put my son's life at risk again, I'll Leave us.",6,2,42
5826,tywin, m,tywin," Put the book away, girl. Maybe you should devise our next battle plan while you're about it.",6,2,17
5827,tywin, m,tywin, Mmm. Give us the room.,6,2,5
5828,tywin, m,tywin, (to Arya) Clear all this.,6,2,5
5829,tywin, m,tywin, (not amused) Baelish.,6,2,3
5830,tywin, m,tywin,  Wine?,6,2,1
5831,tywin, m,tywin, What news from the capital?,6,2,5
5832,tywin, m,tywin," Ah, the late King Renly. Rather a short reign. Murdered by a woman, I hear.",6,2,15
5833,tywin, m,tywin, Here. Men love to blame demons when their grand plans unravel.,6,2,11
5834,tywin, m,tywin," You say that as if you were the first man alive to think it. Yes, a crisis is an opportunity. What other brilliant insights have you brought me today?",6,2,29
5835,tywin, m,tywin,"  Yes, yes, yes.",6,2,3
5836,tywin, m,tywin, Wants to be queen.,6,2,4
5837,tywin, m,tywin, House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne. Against my grandson.,6,2,10
5838,tywin, m,tywin, (to Arya) More wine for Lord Baelish.,6,2,7
5839,tywin, m,tywin, You would ride there yourself?,6,2,5
5840,tywin, m,tywin,"  I'll have an answer by nightfall. That'll be all, girl.",6,2,10
5841,tywin, m,tywin, And what else?,6,2,3
5842,tywin, m,tywin, Why?,6,2,1
5843,tywin, m,tywin, Hmm.,6,2,1
5844,tywin, m,tywin, Who taught you to read?,6,2,5
5845,tywin, m,tywin," Hmm. I taught my son Jaime to read. The maester came to me one day, told me he wasn't learning. He couldn't make sense of the letters. He reversed them in his head. The maester said he'd heard tell of this affliction and that we simply must accept it. Ha! After that, I sat Jaime down for four hours every day until he learned. He hated me for it, for a time. For a long time. But he learned. Hmm. Where is your father? Is he alive? Who was he?",6,2,90
5846,tywin, m,tywin, Quite a man. What killed him?,6,2,6
5847,tywin, m,tywin," You're a sharp little thing, aren't you?",6,2,7
5848,tywin, m,tywin, No. But you've already begun.,6,2,5
5849,tywin, m,tywin, I did. I grew up with him. I watched him grow old.,6,2,12
5850,tywin, m,tywin," He loved us. He was a good man, but a weak man. A weak man who nearly destroyed our house and name. I'm cold.",6,2,24
5851,tywin, m,tywin, Mmm.,6,2,1
5852,tywin, m,tywin, Guard!,6,2,1
5853,tywin, m,tywin, Wolfsbane. A rare substance. This is no common assassin.,7,2,9
5854,tywin, m,tywin, I don't care if you hanged 100. A man tried to kill me. I want his name and I want his head.,7,2,22
5855,tywin, m,tywin," Pretentious name for a band of outlaws. We can't allow rebels behind our lines to harass us with impunity. We look like fools and they look like heroes. That's how kings fall. I want them dead, every one.",7,2,38
5856,tywin, m,tywin, Mmm. Is that mutton?,7,2,4
5857,tywin, m,tywin, Don't like mutton.,7,2,3
5858,tywin, m,tywin, Leave it. Are you hungry?,7,2,5
5859,tywin, m,tywin, Of course you are. Eat.,7,2,5
5860,tywin, m,tywin, It's bad manners to refuse a lord's offer. Sit. Eat.,7,2,10
5861,tywin, m,tywin,  You're small for your age. I suppose you've been underfed your whole life.,7,2,13
5862,tywin, m,tywin,  Mmm. This will be my last war. Win or lose.,7,2,10
5863,tywin, m,tywin, Do you think I'd be in my position if I had lost a war?,7,2,14
5864,tywin, m,tywin," But this is the one I'll be remembered for. The War of Five Kings, they're calling it. My legacy will be determined in the coming months.",7,2,26
5865,tywin, m,tywin, Do you know what legacy means? It's what you pass down to your children and your children's children. It's what remains of you when you're gone. Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy. The greatest fortress ever built.,7,2,41
5866,tywin, m,tywin, Yes. Dragons happened.,7,2,3
5867,tywin, m,tywin," Harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land. A million men could have marched on these walls, and a million men would have been repelled. But an attack from the air with dragon fire Mmm-mmm. Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls. Aegon Targaryen changed the rules. That's why every child alive still knows his name",7,2,61
5868,tywin, m,tywin, Mmm?,7,2,1
5869,tywin, m,tywin," Correct. A student of history, are you?",7,2,7
5870,tywin, m,tywin, I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.,7,2,10
5871,tywin, m,tywin," Hmm. She's a heroine of yours, I take it?",7,2,9
5872,tywin, m,tywin,  Aren't most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs? Jonquil with the flowers in her hair?,7,2,19
5873,tywin, m,tywin, You remind me of my daughter. Where did you learn all this stuff about Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword?,7,2,20
5874,tywin, m,tywin, He was a well-read stonemason. Can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason.,7,2,13
5875,tywin, m,tywin," Careful now, girl. I enjoy you, but be careful. Take that back to the kitchen. Eat what you want.",7,2,19
5876,tywin, m,tywin," And, girl.",7,2,2
5877,tywin, m,tywin," ""M'lord.",7,2,1
5878,tywin, m,tywin," "" Lowborn girls say ""m'lord,"" not ""my lord. "" If you're going to pose as a commoner, you should do it properly.",7,2,22
5879,tywin, m,tywin, You're too smart for your own good. Has anyone told you that?,7,2,12
5880,tywin, m,tywin, Go on.,7,2,2
5881,tywin, m,tywin,"  The boy may lack experience and sense, but he does have a certain mindless provincial courage.",9,1,16
5882,tywin, m,tywin,"  l do hope your savages are going to be of some use, otherwise we've wasted good steel on them.",9,1,19
5883,tywin, m,tywin,"  When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard.",9,1,13
5884,tywin, m,tywin,"  When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander.",9,1,10
5885,tywin, m,tywin,  There'll be no more discussion on the matter.,9,1,8
5886,tywin, m,tywin,  You're wounded.,9,1,2
5887,tywin, m,tywin,"  Huh! The scouts were wrong. There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20 [thousand].",9,1,13
5888,tywin, m,tywin,  He wasn't here.,9,1,3
5889,tywin, m,tywin,"  With his other 18,000 men.",9,1,5
5890,tywin, m,tywin,  The rumors of your demise were unfounded.,8,1,7
5891,tywin, m,tywin,  And who are these Companions of yours?,8,1,7
5892,tywin, m,tywin,"  This is Shagga Son of Dolf, Chieftain of the Stone Crows.",8,1,11
5893,tywin, m,tywin,  You left us no choice. The honor of the House was at stake.,8,1,13
5894,tywin, m,tywin,  Is our hostage.,8,1,3
5895,tywin, m,tywin,  Robert Baratheon is dead.,8,1,4
5896,tywin, m,tywin,  A green boy.,8,1,3
5897,tywin, m,tywin,  The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.,8,1,7
5898,tywin, m,tywin,  It is said that the men of the Mountain clans are great warriors.,8,1,13
5899,tywin, m,tywin,  They have my son.,10,1,4
5900,tywin, m,tywin,"  (shouting)  They have my son! Get out, all of you. (to Tyrion) Not you. You were right about Eddard Stark. lf he were alive, we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, which would have given us more time to deal with Robert's brothers. But now – madness. Madness and stupidity. l always thought you were a stunted fool. Perhaps l was wrong. ",10,1,68
5901,tywin, m,tywin,  No one will stay here. Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the Riverland on fire from God's Eye to the Red Fork. The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal. And you will go to King's Landing.,10,1,41
5902,tywin, m,tywin,"  Rule. You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead. You will bring that boy king to heel, and his mother too, if needs be. And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest – Baelish, Varys, Pycelle…",10,1,47
5903,tywin, m,tywin,"  You're my son. Oh, one more thing. You will not take that whore to court. Do you understand?",10,1,18
5904,tywin, m,tywin,  Attacking him was stupid.,7,1,4
5905,tywin, m,tywin,  Lannisters don't act like fools.,7,1,5
5906,tywin, m,tywin,  Why is he still alive?,7,1,5
5907,tywin, m,tywin,  Ned Stark.,7,1,2
5908,tywin, m,tywin,  Why is he still alive?,7,1,5
5909,tywin, m,tywin,  Clean...,7,1,1
5910,tywin, m,tywin,  You spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you.,7,1,13
5911,tywin, m,tywin,  Now that's what you want people to think of you.,7,1,10
5912,tywin, m,tywin," When you hear them whispering ""Kingslayer"" behind your back, doesn't it bother you?",7,1,13
5913,tywin, m,tywin,  The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.,7,1,11
5914,tywin, m,tywin,"  He's a Lannister. He might be the lowest of the Lannisters, but he's one of us.",7,1,16
5915,tywin, m,tywin,"  No, it's not an opinion, it's a fact!",7,1,8
5916,tywin, m,tywin,  Hmm.,7,1,1
5917,ellaria, f,ellaria, You're going to fight that?,8,4,5
5918,ellaria, f,ellaria, He is the biggest man I've ever seen.,8,4,8
5919,ellaria, f,ellaria, Don't leave me alone in this world.,8,4,7
5920,ellaria, f,ellaria, No?,3,4,1
5921,ellaria, f,ellaria," That's quite all right, lover. It's more for you.",3,4,9
5922,ellaria, f,ellaria, Children.,3,4,1
5923,ellaria, f,ellaria, He is a prince of Dorne. Girls and boys will line up to fuck him till the day he dies.,3,4,20
5924,ellaria, f,ellaria," Call my name if you need me, lover.",3,4,8
5925,ellaria, f,ellaria,  My lord. My lady.,2,4,4
5926,ellaria, f,ellaria," We are everywhere in Dorne. I have 10,000 brothers and sisters.",2,4,11
5927,ellaria, f,ellaria, Beautiful. But pale.,1,4,3
5928,ellaria, f,ellaria, Timid. Timid bores me.,1,4,4
5929,ellaria, f,ellaria, (Laughs) Not timid.,1,4,3
5930,ellaria, f,ellaria, This one will do nicely.,1,4,5
5931,ellaria, f,ellaria," Oh, I'm not a lady.",1,4,5
5932,ellaria, f,ellaria, A lie anywhere. Why not use the right words? I'm a bastard. She is a whore. And you're what? A procurer.,1,4,21
5933,ellaria, f,ellaria, Oberyn.,1,4,1
5934,ellaria, f,ellaria,"  Oberyn, don't.",1,4,2
5935,ellaria, f,ellaria," Come with me, lover.",1,4,4
5936,ellaria, f,ellaria, What are you doing in Dorne?,9,5,6
5937,ellaria, f,ellaria," No, you want to break bread with the Lannisters.",9,5,9
5938,ellaria, f,ellaria, The word of a Kingslayer.,9,5,5
5939,ellaria, f,ellaria, No wonder you can’t stand. You have no spine.,9,5,9
5940,ellaria, f,ellaria, You write like a 7 year old.,9,5,7
5941,ellaria, f,ellaria, He didn’t try to make you pay?,9,5,7
5942,ellaria, f,ellaria, Then maybe he’s changed. The Queen will be thrilled to know you’ll be bringing her daughter home,9,5,17
5943,ellaria, f,ellaria," You love her very much, don’t you?",9,5,7
5944,ellaria, f,ellaria, I wasn’t talking about her.,9,5,5
5945,ellaria, f,ellaria," You think I disapprove. Why? Because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from? They disapproved of Oberyn and me where you are from. Here, no one blinked an eye. 100 years ago, no one would have blinked an eye at you if you had been named Targaryen.  It’s always changing, who we’re supposed to love and who we’re not.The only thing that stays the same is that we want who we want.",9,5,76
5946,ellaria, f,ellaria, I know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man I loved. Perhaps even you were innocent of that.,9,5,25
5947,ellaria, f,ellaria, Forgive me child. I wish you all the happiness in the world.,10,5,12
5948,ellaria, f,ellaria," Remove myself from my path, or I'll take that long axe and shove it--",2,5,14
5949,ellaria, f,ellaria," Your brother was murdered, and you sit here at the Water Gardens, staring at the sky and doing nothing.",2,5,19
5950,ellaria, f,ellaria, Your brother--,2,5,2
5951,ellaria, f,ellaria, What will you do about his death.,2,5,7
5952,ellaria, f,ellaria, You would have me go to war?,2,5,7
5953,ellaria, f,ellaria, The whole country would have you go to war.,2,5,9
5954,ellaria, f,ellaria, The Sand Snakes are with me. They have the love of their people. They will avenge your father while you sit here in your chair doing nothing.,2,5,27
5955,ellaria, f,ellaria," Oberyn is dead. And this Lannister girl skips about the Water Gardens eating our food, breathing our air. How many of your brothers and sisters do they have to kill?",2,5,30
5956,ellaria, f,ellaria, And how long will that be?,2,5,6
5957,ellaria, f,ellaria," Unbowed, unbent, unbroken. For Oberyn.",6,5,5
5958,ellaria, f,ellaria,"  It's called war.  You don't have the stomach for it, scurry back into hiding.",2,7,14
5959,ellaria, f,ellaria,  She was a Lannister.  There are no innocent Lannisters.  My greatest regret is that Oberyn died fighting for you.,2,7,19
5960,ellaria, f,ellaria,"  How can you drink this piss?  When we reach Sunspear I'll treat you to a Dornish red, the best in the world.  Have you ever been to Dorne?",2,7,28
5961,ellaria, f,ellaria,   A boy in every port?,2,7,5
5962,ellaria, f,ellaria,  Could we get some more?,2,7,5
5963,ellaria, f,ellaria,  I'm developing a taste for it.,2,7,6
5964,ellaria, f,ellaria,"  So, you're going to be Queen of the Iron Islands.",2,7,10
5965,ellaria, f,ellaria,"  And what will you be, handsome?",2,7,6
5966,ellaria, f,ellaria,"  Oh, I see.  Your protector.",2,7,5
5967,ellaria, f,ellaria,  So if someone gets too close to you --,2,7,9
5968,ellaria, f,ellaria,  Why are you standing all the way over there then?  A foreign invasion is under way.  It seems like you don't need a protector.,2,7,24
5969,ellaria, f,ellaria,  Kill us!  Get it over with!,2,7,6
5970,ellaria, f,ellaria," You have nothing to fear from us, Lady Olenna.",10,6,9
5971,ellaria, f,ellaria, The Lannisters have declared war on House Tyrell. They have declared war on Dorne. We must be allies now if we wish to survive.,10,6,24
5972,ellaria, f,ellaria, You’re absolutely right. I chose the wrong words. It is not survival I offer. It is your heart’s desire.,10,6,19
5973,ellaria, f,ellaria, Vengeance. Justice.,10,6,2
5974,ellaria, f,ellaria, And men.,1,6,2
5975,ellaria, f,ellaria," The gods are not fools. You would have been a lousy adventurer. And Oberyn, pfft, he would have been a terrible ruler.",1,6,22
5976,ellaria, f,ellaria," When was the last time you left this palace? You don’t know your own people. Their disgust for you. Elia Martell raped and murdered, and you did nothing. Oberyn martell butchered, and you did nothing. You’re not a Dornishman. You’re not our prince.",1,6,43
5977,ellaria, f,ellaria, Your son is weak just like you. And weak men will never rule Dorne again.,1,6,15
5978,tormund, m,tormund, What’s one old man doing with eight horses?,9,3,8
5979,tormund, m,tormund, And proper steel.,9,3,3
5980,tormund, m,tormund," I hope so.  Killing crows in their castle is tough.  Killing them out here in the open, that’s what we do.",9,3,21
5981,tormund, m,tormund, Spread out.  Surround the hut and move in.,9,3,8
5982,tormund, m,tormund, Clear the barn!,9,3,3
5983,tormund, m,tormund, Thunder.,9,3,1
5984,tormund, m,tormund, Maybe it's ghosts.,9,3,3
5985,tormund, m,tormund," That won’t help you, grandpa.",9,3,5
5986,tormund, m,tormund, Where you riding?,9,3,3
5987,tormund, m,tormund," No, it doesn’t matter now.",9,3,5
5988,tormund, m,tormund, You understand.,9,3,2
5989,tormund, m,tormund," Go on, boy.",9,3,3
5990,tormund, m,tormund, Go on!,9,3,2
5991,tormund, m,tormund, Kill him!,9,3,2
5992,tormund, m,tormund, He’s one of them!,9,3,4
5993,tormund, m,tormund, Do you hear me?,9,3,4
5994,tormund, m,tormund, You’re not gonna die for one of them.,9,3,8
5995,tormund, m,tormund," We're finally going to war, old friend?",3,3,7
5996,tormund, m,tormund,  We'll meet again.,3,3,3
5997,tormund, m,tormund, Shouldn't be long now.,2,3,4
5998,tormund, m,tormund, I smell a crow.,1,3,4
5999,tormund, m,tormund, What do we want with a baby crow?,1,3,8
6000,tormund, m,tormund, That half-handed cunt killed friends of mine. Friends twice your size.,1,3,11
6001,tormund, m,tormund," Plenty of little men tried to put their swords through my heart. And there's plenty of little skeletons buried in the woods. What's your name, boy?",1,3,26
6002,tormund, m,tormund, Your Grace?,1,3,2
6003,tormund, m,tormund," Don't panic, boy. This isn't the damned Night's Watch where we make you swear off girls.",1,3,16
6004,tormund, m,tormund,  Can't believe this pup killed the Halfhand.,1,3,7
6005,tormund, m,tormund, Orell says there are crows patrolling on the Wall. Tell me what you know.,5,3,14
6006,tormund, m,tormund, (sighs)  There are 19 castles guarding the Wall. How many are manned?,5,3,12
6007,tormund, m,tormund, How many men remain in Castle Black?,5,3,7
6008,tormund, m,tormund," I like you, boy. But if you lie to me, I'll pull your guts out through your throat.",5,3,18
6009,tormund, m,tormund, We'll find out soon enough.,5,3,5
6010,tormund, m,tormund, Used to be you couldn't find a tree within a mile of the Wall. Crows would come out every morning with axes.,6,3,22
6011,tormund, m,tormund," Sink your metal deep and make sure it holds before taking your next step. And if you fall, don't scream. You don't want that to be the last thing she remembers.",6,3,31
6012,tormund, m,tormund, Look out!,6,3,2
6013,tormund, m,tormund," Just seeing if you can take a hit, lad.",6,3,9
6014,tormund, m,tormund, (grunts),6,3,1
6015,tormund, m,tormund, (grunts),6,3,1
6016,tormund, m,tormund, No!,6,3,1
6017,tormund, m,tormund, Most men fuck like dogs.,7,3,5
6018,tormund, m,tormund," No grace, no skill. A few dozen thrusts and done. You need to be patient. Give her time. Your cock shouldn't go near her till she's slick as a baby seal. And then you go inside, but slowly. Don't jam it in like you're spearing a pig. (laughts) Come on! Hey, come on.",7,3,53
6019,tormund, m,tormund, Did I ever tell you about her? My Sheila?,9,4,9
6020,tormund, m,tormund," Oh that was a night to remember. Of course, I'd had a good bit to drink *laughs* the fangs were sharp, but she knew how to use them. And she was nice and soft down below. No, she was no ordinary beast. Many's the man who--",9,4,46
6021,tormund, m,tormund, We could be waiting here a while.,9,4,7
6022,tormund, m,tormund, Let's kill some Crows!,9,4,4
6023,tormund, m,tormund, *yells* Come on! *puts out the fire*,9,4,7
6024,tormund, m,tormund," You, over there.",9,4,3
6025,tormund, m,tormund, This is how a man ends.,9,4,6
6026,tormund, m,tormund, I should've thrown you from the top of your wall boy!,9,4,11
6027,tormund, m,tormund, Your old blind man patched me up. Why?,10,4,8
6028,tormund, m,tormund, You want me alive so you can torture me?,10,4,9
6029,tormund, m,tormund, So how do we die? Hanging? Beheading? Drop us from the top of the wall?,10,4,15
6030,tormund, m,tormund, Who decides?,10,4,2
6031,tormund, m,tormund, He your king now?,10,4,4
6032,tormund, m,tormund," You spent too much time with us, Jon Snow. You can never be a kneeler again.",10,4,16
6033,tormund, m,tormund, Words? What kind of words?,10,4,5
6034,tormund, m,tormund, Do what?,10,4,2
6035,tormund, m,tormund," The dead can't hear us, boy.",10,4,6
6036,tormund, m,tormund, Snow. Did you love her? She loved you.,10,4,8
6037,tormund, m,tormund, No. All she ever talked about was killing you. That's how I know. She belongs in the North. The real North. You understand me?,10,4,24
6038,tormund, m,tormund, You plan on killing all the crows yourself?,1,4,8
6039,tormund, m,tormund, We wait for Mance's orders.,1,4,5
6040,tormund, m,tormund," And what is it you want? March on Castle Black with just this lot? Your pretty crow said 1,000 men are nesting there.",1,4,23
6041,tormund, m,tormund," He is? Shouldn't it be ""he was""? You said you put three arrows in him.",1,4,15
6042,tormund, m,tormund," I've seen you slip a shaft through a rabbit's eye at 200 yards. If that boy's still walking, it's 'cause you let him go.",1,4,24
6043,tormund, m,tormund, Thenns. I fucking hate Thenns.,1,4,5
6044,tormund, m,tormund, Mance sent you?,1,4,3
6045,tormund, m,tormund, How did you find us?,1,4,5
6046,tormund, m,tormund," You came from the south, not the north.",1,4,8
6047,tormund, m,tormund, Help yourself.,1,4,2
6048,tormund, m,tormund, I'll answer to Mance. I won't answer to you.,1,4,9
6049,tormund, m,tormund, You trust me Jon Snow?,8,5,5
6050,tormund, m,tormund, We are fools together now.,8,5,5
6051,tormund, m,tormund, Lord of Bones. Been a long time.,8,5,7
6052,tormund, m,tormund, War.,8,5,1
6053,tormund, m,tormund, We should gather the elders find somewhere quiet to talk.,8,5,10
6054,tormund, m,tormund, I’m not giving an order.,8,5,5
6055,tormund, m,tormund, I don’t fight for the crows.,8,5,6
6056,tormund, m,tormund, Gather the elders and let’s talk.,8,5,6
6057,tormund, m,tormund," He’s prettier than both my daughters, but he knows how to fight. He’s young, but he knows how to lead. He didn’t have to come to Hardhome. He came because he needs us. And we need him.",8,5,37
6058,tormund, m,tormund, This is the way.,8,5,4
6059,tormund, m,tormund, I’m not good at counting.,8,5,5
6060,tormund, m,tormund, The free folk are stubborn. You know how long it took Mance to band them together. 20 fucking years.,8,5,19
6061,tormund, m,tormund, They’re running out of food and there’s nothing to hunt. They’ll come around.,8,5,13
6062,tormund, m,tormund," If they get through, everyone dies !",8,5,7
6063,tormund, m,tormund," Wun Wun, to the sea.",8,5,5
6064,tormund, m,tormund, They followed Mance. They won't follow anyone else.,5,5,8
6065,tormund, m,tormund, Hard to lead when you're in chains.,5,5,7
6066,tormund, m,tormund, Why would you do that?,5,5,5
6067,tormund, m,tormund, You sure seemed like my enemy when you were killing my friends.,5,5,12
6068,tormund, m,tormund, And now everything is going to change?,5,5,7
6069,tormund, m,tormund, Why now?,5,5,2
6070,tormund, m,tormund," What would you have me do, (Leans forward), Lord Commander?",5,5,10
6071,tormund, m,tormund, They won't kneel for you and neither will I.,5,5,9
6072,tormund, m,tormund, The day I ask my people to fight with the crows is the day my people cut my guts from my belly and make me eat them.,5,5,27
6073,tormund, m,tormund, (Stands up). Easy thing to say to a man in chains.,5,5,11
6074,tormund, m,tormund, Most of them are at Hardhome. You know where that is?,5,5,11
6075,tormund, m,tormund, We'll need ships.,5,5,3
6076,tormund, m,tormund," All right, then. You're coming with me. You're the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. They need to hear it from you. They need to know the ships they are boarding won’t be torched in the middle of the sea. You come with me, or I don't go.",5,5,48
6077,tormund, m,tormund, You want us to man the castles for you?,1,7,9
6078,tormund, m,tormund, Then that's where I'll go. Looks like we're the Night's Watch now.,1,7,12
6079,tormund, m,tormund, You're a lucky man.,1,7,4
6080,tormund, m,tormund,  Isn't it your job to talk him out of stupid fucking ideas like this?,5,7,14
6081,tormund, m,tormund,  How many queens are there now?,5,7,6
6082,tormund, m,tormund,  And you need to convince the one with the dragons or the one who fucks her brother?,5,7,17
6083,tormund, m,tormund,  How many men did you bring?,5,7,6
6084,tormund, m,tormund,  The big woman?,5,7,3
6085,tormund, m,tormund,  You are.,5,7,2
6086,tormund, m,tormund,  You really want to go out there again?,5,7,8
6087,tormund, m,tormund,  You're not the only ones.,5,7,5
6088,tormund, m,tormund,  My scouts found them a mile south of the Wall.  Said they were on their way here.,5,7,17
6089,tormund, m,tormund,  They want to go beyond the Wall too.,5,7,8
6090,tormund, m,tormund,  You're a fucking Mormont?  Like the last Lord Commander?,5,7,9
6091,tormund, m,tormund,  He hunted us like animals.,5,7,5
6092,tormund, m,tormund,"  Beautiful, eh?  I can breath again.  Down south the air smells like pig shit.",6,7,14
6093,tormund, m,tormund,  I've been to Winterfell.,6,7,4
6094,tormund, m,tormund,"  You have to keep moving.  That's the secret.  Walking is good, fighting is better, fucking is best.",6,7,17
6095,tormund, m,tormund,  We have to make due with what we've got.,6,7,9
6096,tormund, m,tormund,  This one is maybe not so smart.,6,7,7
6097,tormund, m,tormund,  Good.  That's more important than being smart.,6,7,7
6098,tormund, m,tormund,"  Smart people don't come up here looking for the dead.  So, you met this Dragon Queen, huh?  And?",6,7,18
6099,tormund, m,tormund,"  You spent too much time with the free folk and now you don't like kneeling.  Mance Rayder was a great man, a proud man.  The king beyond the wall never bent the knee.  How many of his people died for his pride?",6,7,42
6100,tormund, m,tormund,  You’re the one they call the dog.,6,7,7
6101,tormund, m,tormund,  They told me you were mean.  Were you born mean or you just hate Wildlings?,6,7,15
6102,tormund, m,tormund,  Gingers are beautiful.  We are kissed by fire.  Just like you.,6,7,11
6103,tormund, m,tormund,  Did you trip into the fire when you were a baby?,6,7,11
6104,tormund, m,tormund,  Ever since you've been mean.,6,7,5
6105,tormund, m,tormund,  I don't think you're truly mean.  You have sad eyes.,6,7,10
6106,tormund, m,tormund,  Dick?,6,7,1
6107,tormund, m,tormund,  Ah.  Dick.  I like it.,6,7,5
6108,tormund, m,tormund,  Nope.  It's pussy for me.  I have a beauty waiting for me back at Winterfell.  If I ever get back there.  Yellow hair.  Blue eyes.  Tallest woman you've ever seen.  Almost as tall as you.,6,7,35
6109,tormund, m,tormund,  You know her?,6,7,3
6110,tormund, m,tormund,"  Well, not with her yet, but I see the way she looks at me.",6,7,14
6111,tormund, m,tormund,  You do know her.,6,7,4
6112,tormund, m,tormund,  I want to make babies with her.  Think of the great big monsters.  They'd conquer the world.,6,7,17
6113,tormund, m,tormund,  I'm good at killing people.,6,7,5
6114,tormund, m,tormund, Yeah. The crows keep telling me I'll get used to it.,7,7,11
6115,tormund, m,tormund, Come on!  Run! Run!,7,7,4
6116,tormund, m,tormund, My little crow.,2,8,3
6117,tormund, m,tormund, Almost.,2,8,1
6118,tormund, m,tormund, The dead got there first.,2,8,5
6119,tormund, m,tormund, We had to travel around them to get here. Whoever's not here now is with them.,2,8,16
6120,tormund, m,tormund, Before the sun comes up tomorrow.,2,8,6
6121,tormund, m,tormund, The big woman still here?,2,8,5
6122,tormund, m,tormund, We're all going to die.,2,8,5
6123,tormund, m,tormund, But at least we die together.,2,8,6
6124,tormund, m,tormund," It could be our last night in this world, you know.",2,8,11
6125,tormund, m,tormund, Brought my own.,2,8,3
6126,tormund, m,tormund," They call you ""King Killer.""",2,8,5
6127,tormund, m,tormund," They call me ""Giantsbane."" Want to know why?",2,8,8
6128,tormund, m,tormund, I killed a giant when I was 10. Then I climbed right into bed with his wife.,2,8,17
6129,tormund, m,tormund," When she woke up, you know what she did? Suckled me at her teat for three months. Thought I was her baby. That's how I got so strong. Giant's milk.",2,8,30
6130,tormund, m,tormund, She's not a ser? You're not a knight?,2,8,8
6131,tormund, m,tormund, Why not?,2,8,2
6132,tormund, m,tormund, Fuck tradition.,2,8,2
6133,tormund, m,tormund," I'm no king. But if I were, I'd knight you 10 times over.",2,8,13
6134,tormund, m,tormund, Mm-mm.,2,8,1
6135,tormund, m,tormund, I've always had blue eyes!,1,8,5
6136,tormund, m,tormund, His army's between us and Winterfell. We're on foot.,1,8,9
6137,tormund, m,tormund," If the horses last, we'll get there before the dead.",1,8,10
6138,tormund, m,tormund, We just have to hope the Night King doesn't come first-,1,8,11
6139,tormund, m,tormund, All of it.,4,8,3
6140,tormund, m,tormund, We have to celebrate our victory.,4,8,6
6141,tormund, m,tormund," Yes, it is.",4,8,3
6142,tormund, m,tormund, Ah! To the Dragon Queen!,4,8,5
6143,tormund, m,tormund, I'm fine!,4,8,2
6144,tormund, m,tormund, I saw him riding that thing.,4,8,6
6145,tormund, m,tormund,  No. No. I saw him riding that thing.,4,8,8
6146,tormund, m,tormund, I did. That's why we all agreed to follow him. That's the kind of man he is.,4,8,17
6147,tormund, m,tormund, (laughing) He's little but he's strong. Strong enough to befriend an enemy and get murdered for it!,4,8,17
6148,tormund, m,tormund," Most people get bloody murdered, they stay that way.",4,8,9
6149,tormund, m,tormund, Not this one.,4,8,3
6150,tormund, m,tormund," Ah! He comes back and keeps fighting. Here, north of the Wall, and then back here again. He keeps fighting. He keeps fighting.",4,8,23
6151,tormund, m,tormund, He climbed on a fucking dragon and fought. What kind of person climbs on a fucking dragon? A madman or a king!,4,8,22
6152,tormund, m,tormund," We did it! We faced those icy fucks. Looked right into their blue eyes, and here we are. Now, which one of you cowards shit in my pants?",4,8,28
6153,tormund, m,tormund, Maybe you should be.,4,8,4
6154,tormund, m,tormund," Well, Clegane it's time to drown our sorrows.",4,8,8
6155,tormund, m,tormund, You're not gonna ride the dragon south?,4,8,7
6156,tormund, m,tormund, (scoffs). You weigh as much as two fleas fucking.,4,8,9
6157,tormund, m,tormund, I'm taking the Free Folk home. We've had enough of the south. The women down here don't like me.,4,8,19
6158,tormund, m,tormund, It isn't home. We need room to wander. I'll take them back through Castle Black as soon as the winter storms pass. Back where we belong.,4,8,26
6159,tormund, m,tormund, So would you.,4,8,3
6160,tormund, m,tormund, You never know.,4,8,3
6161,tormund, m,tormund, You've got the North in you. The real North.,4,8,9
6162,tormund, m,tormund, It’s not his men that worry me. It’s his horses. I know what mounted knights can do to us.,9,6,19
6163,tormund, m,tormund, You and Stannis cut through us like piss through snow.,9,6,10
6164,tormund, m,tormund, Good.,9,6,1
6165,tormund, m,tormund, Did you really think that cunt would fight you man to man?,9,6,12
6166,tormund, m,tormund," Rest, Jon Snow. We need you sharp tomorrow.",9,6,8
6167,tormund, m,tormund," I’ve never seen these Bolton fuckers fight. And they’ve never seen the free folk fight, so, yes, there’s hope. You want to avenge your king, don’t you?",9,6,27
6168,tormund, m,tormund, You saw these demons?,9,6,4
6169,tormund, m,tormund," Oh. Well, you loved that cunt Stannis and I loved the man he burned. Mance didn’t have demons in his skull. He didn’t torch people or listen to some red witch. I believed in him. I thought he was the man to lead us through the Long Night. But I was wrong just like you.",9,6,55
6170,tormund, m,tormund, Jon Snow’s not a king.,9,6,5
6171,tormund, m,tormund, I need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight. You want some? I have a jug of sour goat’s milk stronger than any of that grape water you southern twats like sucking on.,9,6,38
6172,tormund, m,tormund, So what do you do all night?,9,6,7
6173,tormund, m,tormund, Happy shitting.,9,6,2
6174,tormund, m,tormund, Don’t.,9,6,1
6175,tormund, m,tormund, Run and fight!,9,6,3
6176,tormund, m,tormund, Hey!,9,6,1
6177,tormund, m,tormund," Fuck this, come on!",9,6,4
6178,tormund, m,tormund, We didn’t invade. We were invited.,10,6,6
6179,tormund, m,tormund, They think you’re some kind of god. The man who returned from the dead.,3,6,14
6180,tormund, m,tormund, I know that.,3,6,3
6181,tormund, m,tormund, I saw your pecker. What kind of god would have a pecker that small?,3,6,14
6182,tormund, m,tormund, Until you.,2,6,2
6183,tormund, m,tormund, Took a lot of knives. I’ll have my men get the wood for a fire. Bodies to burn.,2,6,18
6184,tormund, m,tormund, How many men does he have in his army?,4,6,9
6185,tormund, m,tormund," That can march and fight? 2,000. The rest are children and old people.",4,6,13
6186,tormund, m,tormund," If it weren’t for him, none of us would be here. All of you would be meat in the Night King’s army. And I’d be a pile of charred bones just like Mance.",7,6,33
6187,tormund, m,tormund," The crows killed him because he spoke for the free folk when no other southerners would. He died for us. If we are not willing to do the same for him, we’re cowards. And if that’s what we are, we deserve to be the last of the free folk.",7,6,49
6188,tormund, m,tormund," We’re not clever like you southerners. When we say we’ll do something, we do it.",7,6,15
6189,yara, f,yara, He's your son.,10,3,3
6190,yara, f,yara, He's your son. He's my brother. He's a Greyjoy.,10,3,9
6191,yara, f,yara, And I've made mine. I'm going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet.,10,3,14
6192,yara, f,yara, (voiceover)  I'm going to choose the 50 best killers on the Iron Islands.,10,3,13
6193,yara, f,yara, (voiceover) I'm going to sail up the Narrow Sea all the way to the Weeping Water. I'm going to march on the Dreadfort. I'm going to find my little brother and I'm going to bring him home.,10,3,37
6194,yara, f,yara," They skinned our countrymen and they mutilated my brother, your prince. Your prince.  Everything they've done to him, they've also done to you.",6,4,23
6195,yara, f,yara," As long as they can hurt our prince with impunity, the word ironborn means nothing.",6,4,15
6196,yara, f,yara,  Theon Greyjoy.,6,4,2
6197,yara, f,yara, I'm here for Theon Greyjoy. Take me to the dungeons.,6,4,10
6198,yara, f,yara, Thank you.,6,4,2
6199,yara, f,yara, This way!,6,4,2
6200,yara, f,yara, We're going home.,6,4,3
6201,yara, f,yara," It's all right. It's me, Yara.",6,4,6
6202,yara, f,yara," I'm not tricking you, Theon. I'm saving you.",6,4,8
6203,yara, f,yara," If they catch us in here, we're trapped. Help me with him.",6,4,12
6204,yara, f,yara, You're Theon Greyjoy.,6,4,3
6205,yara, f,yara, Aah! Theon!,6,4,2
6206,yara, f,yara, Give me my brother and no more of your men will die.,6,4,12
6207,yara, f,yara," Make for the ship, now.",6,4,5
6208,yara, f,yara, My brother is dead.,6,4,4
6209,yara, f,yara," Why, it's the Prince of Winterfell.",8,2,6
6210,yara, f,yara,  What envy?,8,2,2
6211,yara, f,yara," You're a great warrior. I saw the bodies above your gates. Which one gave you the tougher fight, the cripple or the six-year-old?",8,2,23
6212,yara, f,yara, You treated them with honor? By butchering them?,8,2,8
6213,yara, f,yara," You seized their home, as is your right. We're ironborn, we take what we need.",8,2,15
6214,yara, f,yara, Then you made them prisoners in their home and they ran away. Is that treachery? I'd call it bravery.,8,2,19
6215,yara, f,yara, Your little boy prisoners made you a promise and you got mad when they broke it? Are you the dumbest cunt alive?,8,2,22
6216,yara, f,yara, A cunt. A dumb cunt who killed the only two Starks in Winterfell. You know how valuable those boys were?,8,2,20
6217,yara, f,yara, You are weak. And you're stupid.,8,2,6
6218,yara, f,yara," Go on, then. Warn me.",8,2,5
6219,yara, f,yara, You're not. I've come to bring you home. Father wants a word.,8,2,12
6220,yara, f,yara," Aye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea. We're islanders, baby brother. Had you forgotten that? Our power comes from our ships. And now that you've decorated your walls with the bodies of the Stark boys, every man in the North wants to see you hanged. When Robb Stark finds out",8,2,52
6221,yara, f,yara, (to her men) Leave us.,8,2,5
6222,yara, f,yara," Theon, you're my blood. We both loved our mother. We both endured our father. Come home with me. Don't die here alone.",8,2,22
6223,yara, f,yara," You were a terrible baby, do you know that? Bawling all the time, never sleeping. And one night, you just wouldn't shut up, screaming like a dying pig. I walked over to your crib, I looked down at you. I wanted to strangle you. And you looked up at me and you stopped screaming. You smiled at me. Don't die so far from the sea.",8,2,65
6224,yara, f,yara,"I live here. Are you angry with me, brother?",3,2,9
6225,yara, f,yara, It's not my fault you didn't recognize me.,3,2,8
6226,yara, f,yara," You were a fat little boy, too, but I recognized you.",3,2,11
6227,yara, f,yara, I wanted to see who you were first. And I did.,3,2,11
6228,yara, f,yara, Father.,3,2,1
6229,yara, f,yara, I've always wanted a castle.,3,2,5
6230,yara, f,yara,The Sea Bitch. We thought she'd be perfect for you.,3,2,10
6231,yara, f,yara, Be careful of their nets.,3,2,5
6232,yara, f,yara, You'd have our father bow down to your other family?,3,2,10
6233,yara, f,yara," Don't you? Make your choice, Theon, and do it quickly. Our ships sail with or without you.",3,2,17
6234,yara, f,yara, I'm heading that way. I can take you there.,2,2,9
6235,yara, f,yara, You been at sea long? Or were there just no women where you came from?,2,2,15
6236,yara, f,yara, You don't know what I'm like.,2,2,6
6237,yara, f,yara, You think I offer free rides to every man in jewelry. Lord Greyjoy.,2,2,13
6238,yara, f,yara, Nine years. Do you still know your way around a ship? Have these hands ever touched a rope?,2,2,18
6239,yara, f,yara, Your blood will be in the sea if I don't watch where I'm going.,2,2,14
6240,yara, f,yara, Is that an offer from my future king?,2,2,8
6241,yara, f,yara, I don't imagine it will be a story fit for children.,2,2,11
6242,yara, f,yara, Anything with a cock is easy to fool.,2,2,8
6243,yara, f,yara," So good to see you, brother. This is a homecoming I'll tell my grandchildren about.",2,2,15
6244,yara, f,yara, You're the one in skirts.,2,2,5
6245,yara, f,yara, Stop. We yield.,5,2,3
6246,yara, f,yara, Congratulations on your first command.,5,2,5
6247,yara, f,yara," Oh, I'm not here for you. I was just on my way to Red Harbor. I've got 30 ships. There's nowhere to put them here. Too narrow.",5,2,27
6248,yara, f,yara," That would never happen. My crew would wait on deck for a year if I asked them to. This lot, though Enjoy the Stony Shore.",5,2,25
6249,yara, f,yara,"  If you want the Iron Throne, take it.  We have an army, a fleet, and three dragons.  We should hit King's Landing now.  Hard.  With everything we have.  The city will fall within a day.",2,7,35
6250,yara, f,yara,  You have mine.,2,7,3
6251,yara, f,yara,  A few times.  Never stayed long.,2,7,6
6252,yara, f,yara,"  A boy, a girl.  Depends on the port.",2,7,8
6253,yara, f,yara,  I thought it wasn't for you.,2,7,6
6254,yara, f,yara,  He's not your servant.,2,7,4
6255,yara, f,yara,  Once I kill my uncle.,2,7,5
6256,yara, f,yara,"  He'll be my advisor, my protector.",2,7,6
6257,yara, f,yara,  He might have to intervene.,2,7,5
6258,yara, f,yara,  Until they've made their intentions known.,2,7,6
6259,yara, f,yara,  Stay here.,2,7,2
6260,yara, f,yara,  Euron.,2,7,1
6261,yara, f,yara,  Your mother is below deck.  Keep her safe.,2,7,8
6262,yara, f,yara, Why don't you just get it over with and kill me?,1,8,11
6263,yara, f,yara, Are we in King's Landing?,1,8,5
6264,yara, f,yara, You picked the losing side.,1,8,5
6265,yara, f,yara," Euron can't defend the Iron Islands, not if he's in King's Landing with all his men and his ships.",1,8,19
6266,yara, f,yara, We can take our home back.,1,8,6
6267,yara, f,yara, Daenerys will need somewhere to retreat if they can't hold the North. Somewhere the dead can't go.,1,8,17
6268,yara, f,yara, You want to go to Winterfell. To fight for the Starks. Go. What is dead may never die.,1,8,18
6269,yara, f,yara, But kill the bastards anyway.,1,8,5
6270,yara, f,yara, Some of you may be quick to forgive. The Ironborn are not. I swore to follow Daenerys Targaryen.,6,8,18
6271,yara, f,yara," She freed us from a tyrant. Cersei is gone because of her, and Jon Snow put a knife in her heart. Let the Unsullied give him what he deserves.",6,8,29
6272,yara, f,yara, Aye.,6,8,1
6273,yara, f,yara, And he paid for them.,9,6,5
6274,yara, f,yara, No more than Westeros.,9,6,4
6275,yara, f,yara, You and I have that in common.,9,6,7
6276,yara, f,yara," His big cock, I think he said. Euron’s offer is also an offer of marriage, you see. You won’t get one without the other.",9,6,24
6277,yara, f,yara," I never demand, but I’m up for anything, really.",9,6,9
6278,yara, f,yara, We’d like you to help us murder an uncle or two who don’t think a woman’s fit to rule.,9,6,19
6279,yara, f,yara, That’s our way of life.,9,6,5
6280,yara, f,yara, No more.,9,6,2
6281,yara, f,yara, The Glovers have retaken Deepwood Motte.,2,6,6
6282,yara, f,yara, They died fighting to a man.,2,6,6
6283,yara, f,yara, What is dead may never die.,2,6,6
6284,yara, f,yara, But they did and our invasion died with them. Deepwood Motte was our last stronghold on the mainland.,2,6,18
6285,yara, f,yara, Why? For more pinecones and rocks?,2,6,6
6286,yara, f,yara," We can defeat anyone at sea, but we’ll never hold lands and castles against mainland armies.",2,6,16
6287,yara, f,yara, I won’t apologize for trying to rescue Theon.,2,6,8
6288,yara, f,yara," Where is your kingdom? We took those castles because the northerners marched off to war. That war is over. The last time we provoked them too far, I watched from that window as they breached our walls and knocked down our towers. I lost two brothers that day.",2,6,48
6289,yara, f,yara, I’m going to find out who did this. I’m going to feed them to the sharks while they live. I swear it by the Salt Throne.,2,6,26
6290,yara, f,yara, My father would’ve wanted me to rule.,2,6,7
6291,yara, f,yara," I am Yara Greyjoy, daughter of Balon Greyjoy, King of the Iron Islands. I claim the Salt Throne.",5,6,18
6292,yara, f,yara," There are many things we’ve never done. We’ve never made our mark upon the world. The great lords of Westeros pay us no mind until our little raids buzz through their kingdoms long enough to become a nuisance. Then they swat us down. They conquer us, humiliate us, and go right back to forgetting we exist.",5,6,56
6293,yara, f,yara, We are a sea people.,5,6,5
6294,yara, f,yara, Our god is a sea god.,5,6,6
6295,yara, f,yara," When I am queen, we will build a fleet that —",5,6,11
6296,yara, f,yara, I am not finished!,5,6,4
6297,yara, f,yara," When did you return, Uncle?",5,6,5
6298,yara, f,yara, I’m glad you’re here. Now I know what my first act as queen will be. To execute the man who killed my father.,5,6,23
6299,yara, f,yara, I will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen.,5,6,11
6300,yara, f,yara, You’re going to seduce the Dragon Queen?,5,6,7
6301,yara, f,yara," They told me you were home and I didn’t believe it. “Theon Greyjoy?” I said. “He’s dead. He’s been dead a long time."" He let you go?",4,6,27
6302,yara, f,yara, I can’t hear you.,4,6,4
6303,yara, f,yara, Look at me. Look at me! Men died trying to rescue you. Good men. My men.,4,6,16
6304,yara, f,yara," You were my brother. You’re a spoiled little cunt, but you were my brother and I risked everything for you and you betrayed me.",4,6,24
6305,yara, f,yara, Stop saying that.,4,6,3
6306,yara, f,yara, I know.,4,6,2
6307,yara, f,yara, He send us one of those pieces. That’s why I came for you.,4,6,13
6308,yara, f,yara, Why did you come here?,4,6,5
6309,yara, f,yara, You heard father was dead and thought you’d claim the crown?,4,6,11
6310,yara, f,yara, You happen to show up on Pyke right before the Kingsmoot?,4,6,11
6311,yara, f,yara, You think any Ironborn wants you to be king? After what you’ve done?,4,6,13
6312,yara, f,yara, What do you want?,4,6,4
6313,yara, f,yara, That doesn’t matter anymore. Stop crying.  Look at me. Tell me what you want.,4,6,14
6314,yara, f,yara, Some of us still like it. Have a drink at least.,7,6,11
6315,yara, f,yara," Don’t go far, love.",7,6,4
6316,yara, f,yara, I’ll find you in a bit.,7,6,6
6317,yara, f,yara, Nothing on the Iron Islands has an ass like that. Doesn’t interest you anymore?,7,6,14
6318,yara, f,yara," I’m sorry. I won’t joke about it. I’ll never hurt you, little brother. Don’t you know that?",7,6,17
6319,yara, f,yara," Of course he is. As long as we’re alive, we’re a threat.",7,6,12
6320,yara, f,yara, It’s a great big world and we have fast ships. Drink.,7,6,11
6321,yara, f,yara, I don’t care what you want. Drink.,7,6,7
6322,yara, f,yara, Drink it all.,7,6,3
6323,yara, f,yara," You’re Ironborn, Theon. I know you’ve had some bad years.",7,6,10
6324,yara, f,yara, But I’m tired of watching you cower like a beat dog. Drink the goddamn ale.,7,6,15
6325,yara, f,yara," Now listen to me. I need you. The real Theon Greyjoy, not this rat shit pretender. Can you find him for me? Drink.",7,6,23
6326,yara, f,yara," You escaped, do you hear me? You got away and you’re never going back. We’ll get justice for you.",7,6,19
6327,yara, f,yara," Fuck justice, then. We’ll get revenge. Drink.",7,6,7
6328,yara, f,yara," Listen to me. If you’re so broken that there’s no coming back, take a knife and cut your wrists. End it. But if you’re staying, Theon, I need you. We’re gonna sail to Meereen. We’re gonna make a pact with this Dragon Queen. And we’re gonna take back the Iron Islands.",7,6,51
6329,yara, f,yara, Are you with me? Are you really with me?,7,6,9
6330,yara, f,yara," Now, since it’s my last night ashore for a long while, I’m gonna go fuck the tits off this one.",7,6,20
6331,jon, m,jon, He breeds them for the Watch.,9,3,6
6332,jon, m,jon, The Watch protects him.,9,3,4
6333,jon, m,jon, We just take the horses and go.  The old man’s no threat.,9,3,12
6334,jon, m,jon, The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief.  They’ll send a lot more to hunt down murderers.,9,3,21
6335,jon, m,jon, Ygritte!,9,3,1
6336,jon, m,jon, You were right the whole time.,9,3,6
6337,jon, m,jon," Ygritte, you know I didn't have a choice. You always knew who I was, what I am.",10,3,17
6338,jon, m,jon, I have to go home now. I know you won't hurt me.,10,3,12
6339,jon, m,jon, I do know some things. I know I love you.,10,3,10
6340,jon, m,jon, I know you love me. But I have to go home now.,10,3,12

6358,jon, m,jon, Jon Snow.,1,3,2
6359,jon, m,jon, Your Grace.,1,3,2
6360,jon, m,jon, The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning.,1,3,10

6363,jon, m,jon, (Hesitates.) I want to be free.,1,3,6
6364,jon, m,jon, We stopped at Craster's Keep on the way north. I saw...,1,3,11
6365,jon, m,jon, I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods. I saw what took it.,1,3,19
6366,jon, m,jon," Because when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew. Thousands of years ago, the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them. I want to fight for the side that fights for the living. Did I come to the right place?",1,3,43

6387,jon, m,jon, You ever climbed it before?,6,3,5
6388,jon, m,jon, Aren't you?,6,3,2
6389,jon, m,jon, You kill someone for them?,6,3,5
6390,jon, m,jon, Can we not talk about that here?,6,3,7
6391,jon, m,jon, Did I seem scared the other day?,6,3,7
6392,jon, m,jon, Only in the beginning.,6,3,4
6393,jon, m,jon, What secret?,6,3,2
6394,jon, m,jon, I won't.,6,3,2
6395,jon, m,jon, (screams),6,3,1
6396,jon, m,jon, (grunts),6,3,1
6397,jon, m,jon, (grunts),6,3,1
6398,jon, m,jon, Take my hand!,6,3,3
6399,jon, m,jon,"  About a week, I think.",7,3,5
6400,jon, m,jon,"  When we went to Castle Black, we took the kingsroad.",7,3,10
6401,jon, m,jon,"  Most of the time, yes.",7,3,5
6402,jon, m,jon,"  They don't, really. It's a great honor to carry your house sigil.",7,3,12
6403,jon, m,jon,  Usually it's the young boys banging the drums.,7,3,8
6404,jon, m,jon, They help the men march.,7,3,5
6405,jon, m,jon," No. No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming.",7,3,20
6406,jon, m,jon, I know you cut me loose on the Wall.,7,3,9
6407,jon, m,jon, And are you gonna share it with me? The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird?,7,3,19
6408,jon, m,jon, You're gonna scare it off.,7,3,5
6409,jon, m,jon, It's too far away.,7,3,4
6410,jon, m,jon,  It's a windmill.,7,3,3
6411,jon, m,jon,  Just the men who used to live here.,7,3,8
6412,jon, m,jon, Winterfell has towers three times that size.,7,3,7
6413,jon, m,jon," If you're impressed by a windmill, you'd be swooning if you saw the Great Keep at Winterfell.",7,3,17
6414,jon, m,jon,  Fainting.,7,3,1
6415,jon, m,jon,  When a girl sees blood and collapses.,7,3,7
6416,jon, m,jon,  Well not all girls are like you.,7,3,7
6417,jon, m,jon, I'd like to see you in a silk dress.,7,3,9
6418,jon, m,jon,  So I could tear it off you.,7,3,7
6419,jon, m,jon, Maybe one day I'll take you to Winterfell.,7,3,8
6420,jon, m,jon," Ygritte. You won't win. I know your people are brave, no one denies that.",7,3,14
6421,jon, m,jon," Six times in the last thousand years, a King has attacked the kingdoms. Six times they failed.",7,3,17
6422,jon, m,jon,"  Every boy in the North knows it. We grow up learning it. Where the battles were fought, the names of the heroes, who died where. Six times you've invaded and six times you've failed. The seventh will be the same.",7,3,40
6423,jon, m,jon, You don't have the discipline. You don't have the training. Your army is no army. You don't know how to fight together.,7,3,22
6424,jon, m,jon," I do. I know it. If you attack the Wall, you'll die. All of you.",7,3,15
6425,jon, m,jon," Yes, first we'll live.",7,3,4
6426,jon, m,jon, She...she had red hair.,9,4,4
6427,jon, m,jon, Well what do you want me to say?,9,4,8
6428,jon, m,jon, So you and Gilly never-,9,4,5
6429,jon, m,jon," But if she had, you would've? You'd have broken your vows?",9,4,11
6430,jon, m,jon, What?,9,4,1
6431,jon, m,jon, I don't think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation.,9,4,9
6432,jon, m,jon," It's...there's this person, this whole other person. And you're wrapped up in them and they're wrapped up in you and...you...for a little...for a little while you're more than just you, you're...well I don't know, I'm not a bleedin' poet!",9,4,39
6433,jon, m,jon, And what did I get for it? An arrow six inches from my heart.,9,4,14
6434,jon, m,jon, There will.,9,4,2
6435,jon, m,jon," Go get some sleep, Sam. I'll take this watch.",9,4,9
6436,jon, m,jon," There we go, boys. That's one. There's two. Come on, let's get the next lot. That's the last of the oil, Ser Alliser.",9,4,23
6437,jon, m,jon, Yes sir.,9,4,2
6438,jon, m,jon," It was a difficult decision either way, Ser.",9,4,8
6439,jon, m,jon, We can't just let them attack the gate!,9,4,8
6440,jon, m,jon," Those are giants riding mammoths down there. Do you think your cold, rolled steel's gonna stop them?",9,4,17
6441,jon, m,jon, Archers! Knock your arrows! Draw! Loose!,9,4,6
6442,jon, m,jon, They won't summit before dawn.,9,4,5
6443,jon, m,jon, Because I've made that claim.,9,4,5
6444,jon, m,jon, Knock! Draw! Loose!,9,4,3
6445,jon, m,jon, Now!,9,4,1
6446,jon, m,jon," *to Grenn* The outer gate won't hold. Take five men, hold the inner gate.",9,4,14
6447,jon, m,jon, *grabs Grenn's arm* Hold the gate. If they make it through...,9,4,11
6448,jon, m,jon, Oil!,9,4,1
6449,jon, m,jon, What are you doing up here?,9,4,6
6450,jon, m,jon," Ed. You have The Wall. If they try the mammoths again, drop fire on them. If the climbers get too high, drop the scythe on them.",9,4,26
6451,jon, m,jon, Two brothers now fight with me.,9,4,6
6452,jon, m,jon, *to Sam* I don't want you out there.,9,4,8
6453,jon, m,jon, I need him more than I need you.,9,4,8
6454,jon, m,jon," No, shh, don't talk.",9,4,4
6455,jon, m,jon, We'll go back there.,9,4,4
6456,jon, m,jon," Tormund. It's over, let it end.",9,4,6
6457,jon, m,jon, Put him in chains. We'll question him later.,9,4,8
6458,jon, m,jon," Aye, you should've.",9,4,3
6459,jon, m,jon, For one night.,9,4,3
6460,jon, m,jon," Great victory? Mance was testing our defenses. He almost made it through. And he has more giants, he has more mammoths. He has a thousand times as many men. They'll hit us again tonight. Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two, but we can never beat them.",9,4,51
6461,jon, m,jon, I'm going to find Mance.,9,4,5
6462,jon, m,jon," Who's left to give orders? The Wildling army is only an army because of Mance. He united a hundred warring tribes. Without Mance they lose their leader. They lose their purpose, they go back to fighting each other, scatter back to their home.",9,4,43
6463,jon, m,jon, I'm going to try.,9,4,4
6464,jon, m,jon, He'll kill me. If I don't go he'll kill me anyway. They'll kill the rest of us too.,9,4,18
6465,jon, m,jon, You're right. It's a bad plan. What's your plan?,9,4,9
6466,jon, m,jon," They held the gate. Get some brothers down here to help you. You need to burn the bodies. Raise the outer gate, then lower it again as soon as I'm out.",9,4,31
6467,jon, m,jon, I promised Jeor I'd never lose it again. *he hands the sword to Sam* In case I don't come back.,9,4,20
6468,jon, m,jon, You couldn't have known.,8,4,4
6469,jon, m,jon," We can't go after them, you know that. That's what they want.",8,4,12
6470,jon, m,jon," If they hit Mole's Town, then we're next. Mance's army must be close.",8,4,13
6471,jon, m,jon, I've been sent to negotiate with you.,10,4,7
6472,jon, m,jon," The Halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black. He made me kill him so you'd trust me. I was loyal, to him and to my Night's Watch vows.",10,4,38
6473,jon, m,jon, She put three arrows in me when I escaped.,10,4,9
6474,jon, m,jon, Yes.,10,4,1
6475,jon, m,jon, She's dead.,10,4,2
6476,jon, m,jon, No.,10,4,1
6477,jon, m,jon, Ygritte.,10,4,1
6478,jon, m,jon, That's not wine.,10,4,3
6479,jon, m,jon, He's dead. He killed my friend Grenn.,10,4,7
6480,jon, m,jon, Grenn came from a farm.,10,4,5
6481,jon, m,jon, Grenn and Mag.,10,4,3
6482,jon, m,jon, Turn your army around and go home.,10,4,7
6483,jon, m,jon, I told Tormund and Orell. We have more than a thousand men.,10,4,12
6484,jon, m,jon," No, it's like you said, we don't have the men.",10,4,10
6485,jon, m,jon, I was sent to discuss terms with the king beyond the wall.,10,4,12
6486,jon, m,jon," I know he's the king. My father died for him. My name is Jon Snow, your grace. I'm Ned Stark's son.",10,4,21
6487,jon, m,jon," He was, your grace.",10,4,4
6488,jon, m,jon," I was this man's prisoner once. He could've tortured me, he could've killed me, but he spared my life. I think my father would've taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say.",10,4,34
6489,jon, m,jon," Your grace. If my father'd seen the things that I've seen, he'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall. All of them.",10,4,24
6490,jon, m,jon," He's sworn to treat all wounded men, friend or foe.",10,4,10
6491,jon, m,jon, No one's going to torture you.,10,4,6
6492,jon, m,jon, I don't know what happens to the prisoners.,10,4,8
6493,jon, m,jon, I suppose Stannis does.,10,4,4
6494,jon, m,jon, I don't have a king.,10,4,5
6495,jon, m,jon, We're gonna burn the bodies of your dead. Do you want to say any words over them?,10,4,17
6496,jon, m,jon, Funeral words. I don't know how the Free Folk do it.,10,4,11
6497,jon, m,jon, Say farewell.,10,4,2
6498,jon, m,jon, She told you?,10,4,3
6499,jon, m,jon," Mance Rayder is coming. If the wildlings breach the Wall, they'll roll over everything and everyone for 1,000 Miles before they reach an army that can stop them.",3,4,28
6500,jon, m,jon, Help him.,3,4,2
6501,jon, m,jon, And the mutineers stayed?,3,4,4
6502,jon, m,jon, We need to ride north and kill them all.,3,4,9
6503,jon, m,jon,"  It's not about justice. I told the wildlings we had over 1,000 men at Castle Black alone. Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do. How long do you think they'll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off? Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet. As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will. Then he'll throw his full strength at us. And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings, there's still not a thing we can do to stop them.",3,4,102
6504,jon, m,jon," Last time I saw him, he was in the courtyard at Winterfell. ""He said, "" Next time I see you, you'll be all in black."" I was jealous of Robb my whole life. (Winces) The way my father looked at him, I wanted that. He was better than me at everything... fighting and hunting and riding and girls. Gods, the girls loved him. I wanted to hate him, but I never could.",1,4,72
6505,jon, m,jon, (Chuckles),1,4,1
6506,jon, m,jon, He's wanted to hang me for a while. Now's his chance.,1,4,11
6507,jon, m,jon, I've done plenty wrong.,1,4,4
6508,jon, m,jon, I didn't murder him.,1,4,4
6509,jon, m,jon, He wanted me to kill him.,1,4,6
6510,jon, m,jon, The Halfhand believed our only chance to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army.,1,4,17
6511,jon, m,jon," Then you'd know he'd do anything to defend the Wall. The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him...",1,4,23
6512,jon, m,jon," Aye, I talk like a wildling. I ate with the wildlings. I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I... I laid with a wildling girl.",1,4,25
6513,jon, m,jon, I do.,1,4,2
6514,jon, m,jon," While we sit here debating which rules I broke, Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of 100,000.",1,4,20
6515,jon, m,jon," 100,000. He's united the Thenns, the Hornfoots, the ice-river clans. He has giants fighting for him.",1,4,16
6516,jon, m,jon," Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser?",1,4,8
6517,jon, m,jon, And now you're here. You must not have been very good at your job.,1,4,14
6518,jon, m,jon, There's a band of wildlings south of the Wall already led by Tormund Giantsbane. I killed their warg and three others. They shot me full of arrows. Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north. The signal for the attack will be a bonfire. Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen. That's the truth. All the truth.,1,4,72
6519,jon, m,jon, Do you intend to execute me or am I free to go?,1,4,12
6520,jon, m,jon, How many?,5,4,2
6521,jon, m,jon, Why?,5,4,1
6522,jon, m,jon, (SIGHS) Get some rest. We move at sundown.,5,4,8
6523,jon, m,jon, Are you all right? Come with me. Come on.,5,4,9
6524,jon, m,jon, We lost four brothers?,5,4,4
6525,jon, m,jon, I count 10 dead mutineers.,5,4,5
6526,jon, m,jon, Where in seven hells? Come here.,5,4,6
6527,jon, m,jon," I missed you, boy.",5,4,4
6528,jon, m,jon, It's not safe for you here on your own. Mance Rayder has an army heading this way and there's worse out there than Mance. Come with us to Castle Black. We can find you work. Keep you safe.,5,4,38
6529,jon, m,jon, You want to stay here in Craster's Keep?,5,4,8
6530,jon, m,jon, Bring it through! And again.,4,4,5
6531,jon, m,jon, Very nice. Good.,4,4,3
6532,jon, m,jon, A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand. First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds.,4,4,26
6533,jon, m,jon, Let's see what you can do.,4,4,6
6534,jon, m,jon," Olly, you just watch for now.",4,4,6
6535,jon, m,jon, Have you ever held a sword before? OLLY I was the best archer in our hamlet.,4,4,16
6536,jon, m,jon," You two. Take it slow,  try and disarm each other.",4,4,10
6537,jon, m,jon, You know how to fight. You could have gone easier on him.,4,4,12
6538,jon, m,jon, Grenn and I were helping them.,4,4,6
6539,jon, m,jon, Someone has to train them.,4,4,5
6540,jon, m,jon, My father was highborn. My mother wasn't.,4,4,7
6541,jon, m,jon, Jon Snow.,4,4,2
6542,jon, m,jon, You fight well.,4,4,3
6543,jon, m,jon, She wasn't safe here.,4,4,4
6544,jon, m,jon, Castle Black could be next.,4,4,5
6545,jon, m,jon, We have orders. No one's to leave the castle.,4,4,9
6546,jon, m,jon," And I remember who came after me and brought me home. I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me. When you told me about Bran going beyond the Wall, all I could think about was getting my strength back so I could go and find him.",4,4,47
6547,jon, m,jon, How fast could they travel? A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton?,4,4,16
6548,jon, m,jon, The wildlings have joined up with Mance. Every village or sheltered place will be deserted. Except...,4,4,16
6549,jon, m,jon," Thank you, Ser Alliser.",4,4,4
6550,jon, m,jon," Ahem, brothers.",4,4,2
6551,jon, m,jon," I'm going beyond the Wallto Craster's Keep. I'm going to capture the mutineers holed up there or kill them. I'm asking for volunteers to come with me. There's 60 miles of wilderness between here and Craster's and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us, but we have to do this. Our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does. They know the Wall. They know our defenses. If Mance learns what they know, we're lost. But if that's not enough, then consider this. If the Night's Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father. He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men. Stabbed in the back by cowards. He deserved far better. All we can give him now is justice. Who will join me?",4,4,140
6552,jon, m,jon, I can't let a recruit come north of the Wall.,4,4,10
6553,jon, m,jon," Thank you, brothers.",4,4,3
6554,jon, m,jon, Greetings.,7,4,1
6555,jon, m,jon," Come on, Ghost.",7,4,3
6556,jon, m,jon, Mance's army was closing in on Craster's Keep when we left. We saw their campfires from Osric's Hill. They'll reach the Wall before the next full moon.,7,4,27
6557,jon, m,jon, We need to prepare.,7,4,4
6558,jon, m,jon, We should seal the tunnel. Plug it with rocks and ice. Flood it and let it freeze.,7,4,17
6559,jon, m,jon, We wouldn't.,7,4,2
6560,jon, m,jon," Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser? I have.",7,4,10
6561,jon, m,jon, They won't stop them.,7,4,4
6562,jon, m,jon, The stewards.,7,4,2
6563,jon, m,jon, No.,7,4,1
6564,jon, m,jon, The builders.,7,4,2
6565,jon, m,jon, It was a failure.,9,5,4
6566,jon, m,jon," I went to save them, I failed.",9,5,7
6567,jon, m,jon, I don’t think that fact’s lost on them.,9,5,8
6568,jon, m,jon, Does that make me a fool?,8,5,6
6569,jon, m,jon, He’s not my prisoner.,8,5,4
6570,jon, m,jon, We’re allies.,8,5,2
6571,jon, m,jon, We’re not here to fight. We’re here to talk.,8,5,9
6572,jon, m,jon, My name’s Jon Snow. I’m Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch. We’re not friends. We’ve never been friends. We won’t become friends today. This isn’t about friendship. This is about survival. This is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and what’s out there.,8,5,45
6573,jon, m,jon, In normal times we wouldn’t. But these aren’t normal times. The white walkers don’t care if a man’s Free Folk or Crow. We’re all the same to them. Meat to their army. But together we can beat them.,8,5,38
6574,jon, m,jon, It’s not a trick. It’s a gift for those who join us.,8,5,12
6575,jon, m,jon, Dragonglass. A man of the Night’s Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker.,8,5,16
6576,jon, m,jon, No. But I trust the man.,8,5,6
6577,jon, m,jon, Come with me and I'll share these weapons.,8,5,8
6578,jon, m,jon, There are good lands south of the wall.  The Night's Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands.,8,5,25
6579,jon, m,jon," I knew Mance Rayder. He never wanted a war with the Night’s Watch, he wanted a new life for his people. For you. We’re prepared to give you that new life.",8,5,31
6580,jon, m,jon, If you swear you join us when the real war begins.,8,5,11
6581,jon, m,jon, He died.,8,5,2
6582,jon, m,jon, I put an arrow through his heart.,8,5,7
6583,jon, m,jon," I’m not asking you to forget your dead. I’ll never forget mine. I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the wall. But I’m asking you to think about your children now. They’ll never have children of their own if we don’t band together. The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them. The free folk can’t stop them. The Night’s Watch can’t stop them. And all the southern kings can’t stop them. Only together, all of us, and even then it might not be enough, but at least then we’ll give the fuckers a fight.",8,5,104
6584,jon, m,jon, How many are with us? 5000?,8,5,6
6585,jon, m,jon, We’re leaving too many behind.,8,5,5
6586,jon, m,jon, And he knew them better than I ever will.,8,5,9
6587,jon, m,jon, Get in line! Get in line!,8,5,6
6588,jon, m,jon, Hold the line! Hold the line!,8,5,6
6589,jon, m,jon, Get them to the ship and come back for me!,8,5,10
6590,jon, m,jon, Now!,8,5,1
6591,jon, m,jon, You should be on one of those boats.,8,5,8
6592,jon, m,jon, You have my word. I’ve given orders.,8,5,7
6593,jon, m,jon, Night’s Watch with me! Move! Move! Move!,8,5,7
6594,jon, m,jon, The Dragonglass!,8,5,2
6595,jon, m,jon, The Dragonglass!,8,5,2
6596,jon, m,jon, Go! Go! Go!,8,5,3
6597,jon, m,jon, Let’s go now! Now!,8,5,4
6598,jon, m,jon," He raised his hands. And they all stood up at once. Tens of thousands of them, the biggest army in the world.",10,5,22
6599,jon, m,jon, I’m gonna hope they don’t learn how to climb the wall.,10,5,11
6600,jon, m,jon," No one’s ever getting that back, now. It wouldn’t have mattered anyway, unless we had a mountain of it.",10,5,19
6601,jon, m,jon, With Longclaw. I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass. But Longclaw…,10,5,14
6602,jon, m,jon, Not enough. (pause) The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice the lives of sworn Brothers to save the lives of Wildlings. How’s it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black? (smiles),10,5,37
6603,jon, m,jon, Here’s to us then. Long may they sneer.,10,5,8
6604,jon, m,jon, What?,10,5,1
6605,jon, m,jon," I need you here, Sam. If you leave, who’s left to give me advice I trust?",10,5,16
6606,jon, m,jon," You know that The Citadel will make you swear off women, too.",10,5,12
6607,jon, m,jon, Sam?,10,5,1
6608,jon, m,jon, Sam…,10,5,1
6609,jon, m,jon, You’ve just been beaten half to death. How did you--,10,5,10
6610,jon, m,jon, I’m glad the end of the world’s working out for someone.,10,5,11
6611,jon, m,jon, To your return.,10,5,3
6612,jon, m,jon, We don’t have enough men to make any difference.,10,5,9
6613,jon, m,jon," The wildlings won’t ever fight for Stannis, I told you before--",10,5,11
6614,jon, m,jon, It’s not their fight!,10,5,4
6615,jon, m,jon, Stannis?,10,5,1
6616,jon, m,jon, Are you sure he’s talking about Benjen?,10,5,7
6617,jon, m,jon, He could be lying.,10,5,4
6618,jon, m,jon, Where is he?,10,5,3
6619,jon, m,jon, Olly…,10,5,1
6620,jon, m,jon, (Stands up). Your Grace.,3,5,4
6621,jon, m,jon," Olly is my steward now, as I was Lord Commander Mormont's. I want him to attend my meetings, to learn from men with experience. One day, he might command.",3,5,29
6622,jon, m,jon, I have. And I thank you for it. You do me great honor. All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.,3,5,22
6623,jon, m,jon, But I have to refuse you. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. My place is here.,3,5,17
6624,jon, m,jon," I wish I could fight beside you. Believe me, I do. But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood. I pledged my life to the Night's Watch.",3,5,28
6625,jon, m,jon, I can imagine no higher praise.,3,5,6
6626,jon, m,jon," May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black?",3,5,14
6627,jon, m,jon, You saved us from Mance Rayder's army. We will never forget that. But it's a question of survival. The Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. Winter is coming.,3,5,35
6628,jon, m,jon, And the wildlings?,3,5,3
6629,jon, m,jon," Most of the brothers, yes. There's little love for the free folk here. (Olly stares at him).",3,5,17
6630,jon, m,jon, I heard it was best to keep your enemies close.,3,5,10
6631,jon, m,jon, I'm sorry I disappointed him.,3,5,5
6632,jon, m,jon, As long as he's ruling them.,3,5,6
6633,jon, m,jon, I’ve sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms.,3,5,12
6634,jon, m,jon, And what needs to be done?,3,5,6
6635,jon, m,jon, Sam. (Sam looks up. Jon looks at Maester Aemon’s chair). Maester Aemon?,3,5,12
6636,jon, m,jon," Take good care of him. (To the group). Brothers. As you all know too well, it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit. (Laughter. Jon looks at Alliser). First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task. (Laughter. After a moment, he continues). Brian. Seems like a good job for a ginger.",3,5,62
6637,jon, m,jon," Ser Alliser. (Silence). You have more experience than any other soldier at Castle Black. You proved your valour many times over, while defending the Wall from the wildling attack. I name you First Ranger.",3,5,34
6638,jon, m,jon, Lord Janos. I'm giving you command of Greyguard.,3,5,8
6639,jon, m,jon," Yes, the fort is in a sorry state. Restore it as best you can. First Builder Yarwyck can spare ten of his -",3,5,23
6640,jon, m,jon," You mistake me, my Lord. That was a command, not an offer. Pack your arms and armour, say your farewells, and ride for Greyguard.",3,5,24
6641,jon, m,jon, Are you refusing to obey my order?,3,5,7
6642,jon, m,jon, Take Lord Janos outside.,3,5,4
6643,jon, m,jon," Olly, bring me my sword.",3,5,5
6644,jon, m,jon," If you have any last words, my Lord, now is the time.",3,5,12
6645,jon, m,jon," With respect, Your Grace, the free folk will never follow you, no matter what you do. You're the man who burned their king alive.",2,5,24
6646,jon, m,jon, No. Only one of their own.,2,5,6
6647,jon, m,jon, The Lord Commander's niece.,2,5,4
6648,jon, m,jon," ""Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark."" (Jon smiles)",2,5,17
6649,jon, m,jon," I apologize, Your Grace. Northerners can be a bit like the free folk. Loyal to their own.",2,5,17
6650,jon, m,jon, Most likely.,2,5,2
6651,jon, m,jon," Unpleasant, I expect.",2,5,3
6652,jon, m,jon," I don't doubt it, Your Grace. But I'm a brother of the Night's Watch. I've pledged them my life, my honor, my sword. I don't know what I have left to give you.",2,5,33
6653,jon, m,jon," I can't. Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard. A Snow.",2,5,12
6654,jon, m,jon," It's the first thing I ever remember wanting. I'd daydream that my father would ask the king, and just like that I would never be the bastard of Winterfell again.",2,5,30
6655,jon, m,jon, I'm going to refuse him.,2,5,5
6656,jon, m,jon," I swore a vow to the Night's Watch. If I don't take my own word seriously, what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be?",2,5,25
6657,jon, m,jon, Get your shield up.,1,5,4
6658,jon, m,jon," If it wasn’t heavy it wouldn’t stop a sword, now get it up.",1,5,13
6659,jon, m,jon, Come. Try it again. Drive at me. Keep your shield up. Or I’ll ring your head like a bell.,1,5,19
6660,jon, m,jon," Good, good, pivot! Don’t forget to pivot! Shield up!",1,5,9
6661,jon, m,jon," You’re not cold, my lady?",1,5,5
6662,jon, m,jon, No.,1,5,1
6663,jon, m,jon, Roose Bolton.,1,5,2
6664,jon, m,jon," I want a great many things, your grace. But I’m a sworn brother of the Night’s Watch now.",1,5,18
6665,jon, m,jon, They’re good men.,1,5,3
6666,jon, m,jon, It’s where she belonged.,1,5,4
6667,jon, m,jon, They were born on the wrong side of the wall. That doesn’t make them monsters.,1,5,15
6668,jon, m,jon, The men of the Night’s Watch are sworn to play no part--,1,5,12
6669,jon, m,jon," Your grace, you want the wildlings to march in your army?",1,5,11
6670,jon, m,jon, I don’t think that’s likely.,1,5,5
6671,jon, m,jon, I respect him.,1,5,3
6672,jon, m,jon, Your grace…,1,5,2
6673,jon, m,jon, How much time do I have?,1,5,6
6674,jon, m,jon, Here we are.,1,5,3
6675,jon, m,jon, This doesn’t have to be our last meeting.,1,5,8
6676,jon, m,jon, You know what Stannis wants?,1,5,5
6677,jon, m,jon, Shouldn’t a king be bold?,1,5,5
6678,jon, m,jon, You told me you weren’t here to conquer. You told me your people have bled enough.,1,5,16
6679,jon, m,jon," You spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history. Thenns and Hornfoots, the ice-river clans, even the giants. A life’s work uniting them. You didn’t do it for power. You didn’t do it for glory. You brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter, not if they’re north of the wall. Isn’t their survival more important than your pride?",1,5,72
6680,jon, m,jon, Then bend the knee and save your people.,1,5,8
6681,jon, m,jon, And how many tens of thousands are out there right now? How many women? How many children? And you won’t go out and rescue them because why? You’re afraid of looking afraid.,1,5,32
6682,jon, m,jon, They’ll burn you alive.,1,5,4
6683,jon, m,jon," And what happens to your people? You preserve your dignity and die standing, and they’ll sing songs about you. “You’d rather burn than kneel. The great hero.” Until winter comes, and the white walkers come for us all, and there’s no one left to sing.",1,5,45
6684,jon, m,jon, I think you’re making a terrible mistake.,1,5,7
6685,jon, m,jon, Maester Aemon.,5,5,2
6686,jon, m,jon," Sam, I'd like to speak to the maester alone.",5,5,9
6687,jon, m,jon, How are you feeling?,5,5,4
6688,jon, m,jon," I need your advice. There's something I want to do, something I have to do. But it'll divide the Night's Watch. Bitterly. Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order.",5,5,34
6689,jon, m,jon, But you don't know what it is.,5,5,7
6690,jon, m,jon, Where are the rest of the free folk now? (Tormund scoffs). Where have they gone? (No response). Who leads them?,5,5,20
6691,jon, m,jon, What about you?,5,5,3
6692,jon, m,jon, What if I unchained you?,5,5,5
6693,jon, m,jon, Because you are not my enemy. And I'm not yours.,5,5,10
6694,jon, m,jon," For 8,000 years the Night's Watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men. And for 8,000 years we've fallen short of that oath. You belong to the realms of men. All of you.",5,5,40
6695,jon, m,jon, It is.,5,5,2
6696,jon, m,jon," Because now, (Leans forward), I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.",5,5,12
6697,jon, m,jon, (Stands up). I'd have you go north of the Wall. Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here. I'll open the gates for them and let them through. I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall.,5,5,43
6698,jon, m,jon, I don't want them to kneel for me. I want them to fight with me when the time comes.,5,5,19
6699,jon, m,jon," And how many of your people can't fight? The women, the children, the old, the sick, what happens to them? You're condemning them to death. Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace. Or maybe you're not proud. Maybe you're just a coward.",5,5,45
6700,jon, m,jon, Your people need a leader. And they need to get south of the Wall before it's too late. We don't have much time and they have less. The walkers are coming and they'll hit your people first. I'm not asking you to make peace to save your skin. Make peace to save your people.,5,5,54
6701,jon, m,jon, Up on Storrold's Point. I can give you 10 horses and nine other men. You can get there in a week.,5,5,21
6702,jon, m,jon, I'll talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet.,5,5,10
6703,jon, m,jon," Men, women, and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing.",5,5,13
6704,jon, m,jon, And we've slaughtered theirs.,5,5,4
6705,jon, m,jon," You were at the Fist of the First Men. If we abandon them, you know what they become. We can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead. Whatever they are now, they're better than that.",5,5,45
6706,jon, m,jon," Thank you. (Olly walks away). Olly. (He stops). If you have something you want to say to me, say it. It's all right.",5,5,23
6707,jon, m,jon, It's not a trick.,5,5,4
6708,jon, m,jon, I know what it's like to lose the people you love. I know this is hard for you. But winter is coming. We know what's coming with it. We can't face it alone.,5,5,33
6709,jon, m,jon, No.,5,5,1
6710,jon, m,jon," You'll get them back, I swear it. Have a safe journey, Your Grace. And thank you.",5,5,16
6711,jon, m,jon, (To some of the men sparring). Good.,4,5,7
6712,jon, m,jon, Never even heard of these people.,4,5,6
6713,jon, m,jon, And how many men does this Lord Mazin have to send us?,4,5,12
6714,jon, m,jon, Not him.,4,5,2
6715,jon, m,jon, He murdered my brother.,4,5,4
6716,jon, m,jon, How can I help you?,4,5,5
6717,jon, m,jon, Castle Black is my home now. Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.,4,5,18
6718,jon, m,jon," You're gonna show me some vision in the fire. Forgive me, my Lady. But I don't trust in visions.",4,5,19
6719,jon, m,jon, I don't think Stannis would like that very much.,4,5,9
6720,jon, m,jon, I can't.,4,5,2
6721,jon, m,jon, I swore a vow. (Melisandre looks at him incredulously). I loved another.,4,5,12
6722,jon, m,jon, I know. But I still love her.,4,5,7
6723,jon, m,jon," First Ranger, you have command of Castle Black.",7,5,8
6724,jon, m,jon," As always, thank you for your honesty.",7,5,7
6725,jon, m,jon," Thank you, Sam.",7,5,3
6726,jon, m,jon, Me too.,7,5,2
6727,jon, m,jon," I couldn't do it. I had the sword on her neck, I just couldn't",8,2,14
6728,jon, m,jon, The others?,8,2,2
6729,jon, m,jon, They died because of me.,8,2,5
6730,jon, m,jon, They'll never trust me.,8,2,4
6731,jon, m,jon, What?,8,2,1
6732,jon, m,jon, I didn't.,8,2,2
6733,jon, m,jon, Careful with that. You might cut yourself.,10,2,7
6734,jon, m,jon," Never swung a sword before, have you? You look like a baby with a rattle.",10,2,15
6735,jon, m,jon, Stop!,10,2,1
6736,jon, m,jon, Lord Commander,3,2,2
6737,jon, m,jon," I followed him. He took the baby into the woods, the newborn.",3,2,12
6738,jon, m,jon," No, you don't understand. He's killing them, all the boys.",3,2,10
6739,jon, m,jon, You know.,3,2,2
6740,jon, m,jon, Offerings? He's murdering his own children. He's a monster.,3,2,9
6741,jon, m,jon, I saw it. I saw something take that child.,3,2,9
6742,jon, m,jon, What happens to the boys? What does he do with his sons?,2,2,12
6743,jon, m,jon, What’re you doing?,2,2,3
6744,jon, m,jon," Hello, Gilly. What’re you doing?",2,2,5
6745,jon, m,jon," I'm sorry, Sam knows we're not supposed to -",2,2,9
6746,jon, m,jon, What? (Stands up).,2,2,3
6747,jon, m,jon," No it doesn't sound a bit mad, it's impossible.",2,2,9
6748,jon, m,jon, Sam we can't take her -,2,2,6
6749,jon, m,jon, It's just not possible.,2,2,4
6750,jon, m,jon," If it's a boy what? (Gilly looks around and then down, not answering). You want us to risk our lives for you, and you won't even tell us why.",2,2,29
6751,jon, m,jon," Do what, ask her a question?",2,2,6
6752,jon, m,jon, Cruel! Sam are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?,2,2,12
6753,jon, m,jon, No you just want to steal her. What do you think Craster cuts off for that?,2,2,16
6754,jon, m,jon," We're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory. We can't take a girl with us. Mormont wouldn't have it. And even if he would, what would we do with her? Who's gonna deliver her baby? You?",2,2,36
6755,jon, m,jon," I'm sorry Sam, we can't help her.",2,2,7
6756,jon, m,jon, Having a rough time of it?,1,2,6
6757,jon, m,jon, What happens to the boys?,1,2,5
6758,jon, m,jon, He marries his daughters. What does he do with his sons?,1,2,11
6759,jon, m,jon, (Standing off to the side of the room) We're not Southerners.,1,2,11
6760,jon, m,jon, Jon Snow.,1,2,2
6761,jon, m,jon, Lord commander.,1,2,2
6762,jon, m,jon, Jon Snow.,1,2,2
6763,jon, m,jon, Your steward.,1,2,2
6764,jon, m,jon, When will he come?,5,2,4
6765,jon, m,jon, My uncle told me stories about him.,5,2,7
6766,jon, m,jon, I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the Wall.,5,2,12
6767,jon, m,jon, So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own.,5,2,13
6768,jon, m,jon, I think they were afraid. I think they came here to get away from something. And I don't think it worked.,5,2,21
6769,jon, m,jon, One blast is for rangers returning. Wildlings is two blasts.,5,2,10
6770,jon, m,jon, Look. It's Qhorin Halfhand.,5,2,4
6771,jon, m,jon, A fire.,5,2,2
6772,jon, m,jon,  Where?,5,2,1
6773,jon, m,jon," Lord Commander, I'd like to join Lord Qhorin.",5,2,8
6774,jon, m,jon, I've fought and killed a wight. How many rangers can say that?,5,2,12
6775,jon, m,jon," Ghost, stay with us. Ghost!",6,2,5
6776,jon, m,jon, He's not a pet.,6,2,4
6777,jon, m,jon, Ghost is different.,6,2,3
6778,jon, m,jon, I thought you said you couldn't know wild things.,6,2,9
6779,jon, m,jon, We could do the same.,6,2,5
6780,jon, m,jon, My father always said I'm of the North.,6,2,8
6781,jon, m,jon, I wasn't joking.,6,2,3
6782,jon, m,jon, (nods),6,2,1
6783,jon, m,jon,  I'll gladly give my life.,6,2,5
6784,jon, m,jon, I do.,6,2,2
6785,jon, m,jon, A girl.,6,2,2
6786,jon, m,jon, We could question her.,6,2,4
6787,jon, m,jon, What's your name?,6,2,3
6788,jon, m,jon, I'm Jon Snow.,6,2,3
6789,jon, m,jon," No. No, I'll do it.",6,2,5
6790,jon, m,jon, I'm as much a crow as they are.,6,2,8
6791,jon, m,jon, Can't. Someone might see the smoke.,6,2,6
6792,jon, m,jon, I'll find them.,6,2,3
6793,jon, m,jon, We'll stop here. Too dark to go any farther today.,6,2,10
6794,jon, m,jon, There's no shelter anywhere.,6,2,4
6795,jon, m,jon, No fire.,6,2,2
6796,jon, m,jon, No fire.,6,2,2
6797,jon, m,jon, Yes.,6,2,1
6798,jon, m,jon, Yes.,6,2,1
6799,jon, m,jon, We start again at first light. Get some sleep.,6,2,9
6800,jon, m,jon, Stop moving.,6,2,2
6801,jon, m,jon, Stop it!,6,2,2
6802,jon, m,jon, You're still moving.,6,2,3
6803,jon, m,jon, (sighs),6,2,1
6804,jon, m,jon, Let's move.,7,2,2
6805,jon, m,jon, I'm a man of the Night's Watch.,7,2,7
6806,jon, m,jon, Don't call them that.,7,2,4
6807,jon, m,jon, Neither. Both.,7,2,2
6808,jon, m,jon, Move!,7,2,1
6809,jon, m,jon," There are no women of the Night's Watch, no.",7,2,9
6810,jon, m,jon, No.,7,2,1
6811,jon, m,jon, Never. We swore an oath.,7,2,5
6812,jon, m,jon, Would you please shut up?,7,2,5
6813,jon, m,jon," You're a free woman? I might be your prisoner, but I'm a free woman.",7,2,14
6814,jon, m,jon," If you're my prisoner, you're not a free woman. That's what ""prisoner"" means.",7,2,13
6815,jon, m,jon, It was my choice to say the words.,7,2,8
6816,jon, m,jon, Of course I like girls. But you chose never to touch them.,7,2,12
6817,jon, m,jon, That's the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch.,7,2,16
6818,jon, m,jon," Invade your lands? Wildlings raid our lands all the time. Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy!",7,2,22
6819,jon, m,jon," My father was Ned Stark. I have the blood of the First Men. My ancestors lived here, same as yours.",7,2,20
6820,jon, m,jon," No. No, you serve Mance Rayder, the King beyond the Wall.",7,2,11
6821,jon, m,jon, Walk.,7,2,1
6822,jon, m,jon, I know how to do it.,7,2,6
6823,jon, m,jon, We're close.,7,2,2
6824,jon, m,jon, We're close.,7,2,2
6825,jon, m,jon, Nothing happened between you and me.,7,2,6
6826,jon, m,jon, Turn back around.,7,2,3
6827,jon, m,jon, That's enough.,7,2,2
6828,jon, m,jon, Enough!,7,2,1
6829,jon, m,jon,  The dwarf of Casterly Rock.,3,7,5
6830,jon, m,jon,"  You were pissing off the edge, if I remember right.  You picked up some scars along the road.",3,7,18
6831,jon, m,jon,  Of course.,3,7,2
6832,jon, m,jon,  She is.,3,7,2
6833,jon, m,jon,  I didn't ask --,3,7,4
6834,jon, m,jon,  She's starting to let on.,3,7,5
6835,jon, m,jon,  As long as you tell me how a Lannister became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen.,3,7,14
6836,jon, m,jon,  My bannermen think I'm a fool for coming here.,3,7,9
6837,jon, m,jon,  True.  But I'm not a Stark.,3,7,6
6838,jon, m,jon,"  The winds were kind, Your Grace.",3,7,6
6839,jon, m,jon,  I am not.,3,7,3
6840,jon, m,jon,  Break faith?  Your father burned my grandfather alive.  He burned my uncle alive.  He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms.,3,7,20
6841,jon, m,jon,  You're right.  You're not guilty of your father's crime.  And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.,3,7,17
6842,jon, m,jon,  Because I need your help and you need mine.,3,7,9
6843,jon, m,jon,  I did.,3,7,2
6844,jon, m,jon,  They're hard to miss.,3,7,4
6845,jon, m,jon,  But you haven't stormed King's Landing.  Why not?  The only reason I can see is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people.  It's the fastest way to win the war but you won't do it.  Which means at the very least you're better than Cersei.,3,7,47
6846,jon, m,jon,"  Because right now you and I and Cersei and everyone else, we're children playing at a game screaming that the rules aren't fair.",3,7,23
6847,jon, m,jon,"  Your Grace, everone you know will die before winter is over if we don't defeat the enemy to the north.",3,7,20
6848,jon, m,jon,  I am not your enemy.  The dead are the enemy.,3,7,10
6849,jon, m,jon,  The Army of the Dead is on the march.,3,7,9
6850,jon, m,jon,"  You don't know me well, My Lord, but do you think I am a liar or a madman?",3,7,18
6851,jon, m,jon,  The Army of the Dead is real.  The White Walkers are real.  The Knight King is real.  I've seen them.  If they get past the wall and we're squabbling amongst ourselves --,3,7,32
6852,jon, m,jon,  You'll be ruling over a graveyard if we don't defeat the Night King.,3,7,13
6853,jon, m,jon,  There's no time for that.  There's no time for any of this.  While we stand here debating --,3,7,18
6854,jon, m,jon,  And why would I do that?,3,7,6
6855,jon, m,jon,"  I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you.  As far as I can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name.  And my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King.  The lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them.  And I will continue to do so as well as I can.",3,7,63
6856,jon, m,jon,  Am I your prisoner?,3,7,4
6857,jon, m,jon,  I'm a prisoner on this island.,3,7,6
6858,jon, m,jon,  Except to my ship.  They took my ship.,3,7,8
6859,jon, m,jon,  I'm not playing word games with you.  The dead are coming for us all.,3,7,14
6860,jon, m,jon,  It's hard for me to fathom.  It really is.  If someone told me about the White Walkers and the Night King --,3,7,22
6861,jon, m,jon,  You probably don't believe me.,3,7,5
6862,jon, m,jon,  You didn't before.  Grumpkins and snarks you called them.  Do you remember?  You said it was all nonsense.,3,7,18
6863,jon, m,jon,  How do I convince people who don't know me that an enemey they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?,3,7,22
6864,jon, m,jon,  I know it's a good question.  I'm looking for an answer.,3,7,11
6865,jon, m,jon,  I need to help prepare my people for what's coming.  I can't help them from here.  I'd like to leave.,3,7,20
6866,jon, m,jon,"  Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes.  Don't go south.  Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter, a foreign invader.  And here I am.  A northern fool.",3,7,31
6867,jon, m,jon,  What do you mean?,3,7,4
6868,jon, m,jon,  Amazing thing to see.,3,7,4
6869,jon, m,jon,  You've been talking to Tyrion?,3,7,5
6870,jon, m,jon,  He enjoys talking.,3,7,3
6871,jon, m,jon,  I don't.,3,7,2
6872,jon, m,jon,  I never expected that you would.,3,7,6
6873,jon, m,jon,  I haven't either.,3,7,3
6874,jon, m,jon,  Thank you.,3,7,2
6875,jon, m,jon,  So you believe me then about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?,3,7,15
6876,jon, m,jon,  Read the last bit.,2,7,4
6877,jon, m,jon,  It's something he said to me the first night we met.  You know him better than any of us.  What do you think?,2,7,23
6878,jon, m,jon,  What?,2,7,1
6879,jon, m,jon,  But?,2,7,1
6880,jon, m,jon,  Come in.,2,7,2
6881,jon, m,jon,  This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarley.  He was my brother at the Night's Watch.  A man I trust as much as anyone in this world.  He's discovered proof that Dragonstone sits on a mountain of Dragonglass.,2,7,39
6882,jon, m,jon,  I received this a few days ago from Dragonstone.  It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.,2,7,17
6883,jon, m,jon,"  He's now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen.  She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister.  She has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed, three dragons.",2,7,37
6884,jon, m,jon,  Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys and I'm going to accept.,2,7,16
6885,jon, m,jon,"  We need this Dragonglass, My Lords.  We know that Dragonglass can destroy both White Walkers and their army.  We need to mine it and turn it into weapons.",2,7,28
6886,jon, m,jon,"  But more importantly, we need allies.  The Night King's army grows larger by the day.  We can't defeat them on our own.  We don't have the numbers.  Daenerys has her own army and she has dragon fire.  I need to try and persuade her to fight with us.  Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow, then sail for Dragonstone.",2,7,62
6887,jon, m,jon,  I know that.,2,7,3
6888,jon, m,jon,"  It could be, but I don't believe Tyrion would do that.  You know him.  He's a good man.",2,7,18
6889,jon, m,jon,"  You all crowned me your king.  I never wanted it, I never asked for it, but I accepted it because the north is my home.  It's part of me and I will never stop fighting for it, no matter the odds.  But the odds are against us.  None of you have seen the Army of the Dead.  None of you.  We can never hope to defeat them alone.  We need allies, powerful allies.  I know it's a risk.  But I have to take it.",2,7,84
6890,jon, m,jon,  Daenerys is a queen.  Only a king can convince her to help us.  It has to be me.,2,7,18
6891,jon, m,jon,  I'm leaving both in good hands.,2,7,6
6892,jon, m,jon,"  Yours.  You are my sister.  You are the only Stark in Winterfell.  Until I return, the north is yours.",2,7,19
6893,jon, m,jon,  You don't belong down here.,2,7,5
6894,jon, m,jon,  I have nothing to say to you.,2,7,7
6895,jon, m,jon,  Touch my sister and I'll kill you myself.,2,7,8
6896,jon, m,jon," I want every northern maester to scour their records for any mention of dragonglass. Dragonglass kills white walkers. It's more valuable to us now than gold. We need to find it, we need to mine it, we need to make weapons from it. Everyone aged 10 to 60 will drill daily with spears, pikes, bow and arrow.",1,7,57
6897,jon, m,jon, Not just the boys.,1,7,4
6898,jon, m,jon, We can't defend the North if only half the population is fighting.,1,7,12
6899,jon, m,jon," While we're preparing for attack, we need to shore up our defenses. The only thing standing between us and the Army of the Dead is the Wall and the Wall hasn't been properly manned in centuries. I'm not the king of the Free Folk.",1,7,44
6900,jon, m,jon, But if we're going to survive this winter together...,1,7,9
6901,jon, m,jon, Last time we saw the Night King was at Hardhome. The closest castle to Hardhome is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.,1,7,17
6902,jon, m,jon," If they breach the wall, the first two castles in their path are Last Hearth and Karhold.",1,7,17
6903,jon, m,jon, The Umbers and the Karstarks have fought beside the Starks for centuries. They've kept faith for generation after generation.,1,7,19
6904,jon, m,jon, I'm not going to strip these families of their ancestral homes because of the crimes of a few reckless sons.,1,7,20
6905,jon, m,jon, The punishment for treason is death. Smalljon Umber died on the field of battle. Harald Karstark died on the field of battle.,1,7,22
6906,jon, m,jon," When I was Lord Commander of the Night's Watch I executed men who betrayed me. I executed men who refused to follow orders. My father always said, ""The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword,"" and I have tried to live by those words. But I will not punish a son for his father's sins, and I will not take a family home away from a family it has belonged to for centuries. That is my decision, and my decision is final.",1,7,84
6907,jon, m,jon, Ned Umber.,1,7,2
6908,jon, m,jon, Alys Karstark.,1,7,2
6909,jon, m,jon," For centuries, our families fought side by side on the battlefield. I ask you to pledge your loyalty once again to House Stark, to serve as our bannermen and come to our aid whenever called upon.",1,7,36
6910,jon, m,jon, Stand.,1,7,1
6911,jon, m,jon," Yesterday's wars don't matter anymore. The North needs to band together, all the living north. Will you stand beside me, Ned and Alys, now and always?",1,7,26
6912,jon, m,jon," You are my sister, but I am king now.",1,7,9
6913,jon, m,jon," When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and ladies, you undermine me.",1,7,16
6914,jon, m,jon," Of course you can, but--",1,7,5
6915,jon, m,jon, Do you think I'm Joffrey?,1,7,5
6916,jon, m,jon, Thank you.,1,7,2
6917,jon, m,jon, At what?,1,7,2
6918,jon, m,jon, No.,1,7,1
6919,jon, m,jon," What did father used to say? Everything before the word ""but"" is horse shit.",1,7,14
6920,jon, m,jon," No. No, he never cursed in front of his girls.",1,7,10
6921,jon, m,jon," All right, I'll stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me.",1,7,15
6922,jon, m,jon, And how should I be smarter? By listening to you?,1,7,10
6923,jon, m,jon," ""Cersei of House Lannister, First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms--""",1,7,21
6924,jon, m,jon, Come to King's Landing. Bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors.,1,7,14
6925,jon, m,jon," I'm consumed with the Night King because I've seen him. And believe me, you'd think of little else if you had, too.",1,7,22
6926,jon, m,jon, There's a thousand miles between us and Cersei. Winter is here. The Lannisters are a southern army. They've never ranged this far north.,1,7,23
6927,jon, m,jon, You almost sound as if you admire her.,1,7,8
6928,jon, m,jon,"  That wasn't the word I was thinking of, but, yes, they are.  Gorgeous beasts.",5,7,14
6929,jon, m,jon,  You weren't gone long.,5,7,4
6930,jon, m,jon,  And?,5,7,1
6931,jon, m,jon,"  No, I'm not.",5,7,3
6932,jon, m,jon,  Thousands.,5,7,1
6933,jon, m,jon,  Ser Davos gets carried away.,5,7,5
6934,jon, m,jon,  I served with your father.  He was a great man.,5,7,10
6935,jon, m,jon,  I thought Arya was dead.  I thought Bran was dead.,5,7,10
6936,jon, m,jon,  Bran saw the Night King and his army marching towards Eastwatch.  If they make it past the wall --,5,7,19
6937,jon, m,jon,  I need to go home.,5,7,5
6938,jon, m,jon,  We'll fight with the men we have.  Unless you'll join us.,5,7,11
6939,jon, m,jon,  I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation.,5,7,11
6940,jon, m,jon,  The first White I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall.,5,7,15
6941,jon, m,jon,  The free folk will help us.  They know the real north better than anyone.,5,7,14
6942,jon, m,jon,  They won't have to.,5,7,4
6943,jon, m,jon,  I'm the only one here whose fought them.  I'm the only one here who knows them.,5,7,16
6944,jon, m,jon,"  With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission.  I am a king.  And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive.  I put my trust in you, a stranger, because I knew it was the best chance for my people, for all our people.  Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger because it's our best chance.",5,7,69
6945,jon, m,jon,  You survived King's Landing.,5,7,4
6946,jon, m,jon,"  Your Grace, this is --",5,7,5
6947,jon, m,jon,  I saw your father once at Winterfell.,5,7,7
6948,jon, m,jon,  You're a lot leaner.,5,7,4
6949,jon, m,jon,  I grew up on stories about them.,5,7,7
6950,jon, m,jon,  Do you know how to use one?,5,7,7
6951,jon, m,jon,"  Well, that's a problem.",5,7,4
6952,jon, m,jon,  We could use the help.,5,7,5
6953,jon, m,jon,  If I don't return at least you won't have to deal with the King in the North anymore.,5,7,18
6954,jon, m,jon,"  I wish you good fortune in the wars to come, Your Grace.",5,7,12
6955,jon, m,jon,  Heave!,5,7,1
6956,jon, m,jon,  Two.,5,7,1
6957,jon, m,jon,  Both.,5,7,1
6958,jon, m,jon,  Not enough.,5,7,2
6959,jon, m,jon,  You're The Hound.  I saw you once at Winterfell.,5,7,9
6960,jon, m,jon,  He's right.  We're all on the same side.,5,7,8
6961,jon, m,jon,  We're all breathing.,5,7,3
6962,jon, m,jon,  Your Grace.,4,7,2
6963,jon, m,jon,  I wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits.,4,7,13
6964,jon, m,jon,"  So this is it, all we'll ever need.",4,7,8
6965,jon, m,jon,"  There is something else I want to show your, Your Grace.",4,7,11
6966,jon, m,jon,  The Children of the Forest made these.,4,7,7
6967,jon, m,jon,  A very long time ago.,4,7,5
6968,jon, m,jon,  No.,4,7,1
6969,jon, m,jon,  They were here together the Children and the First Men.,4,7,10
6970,jon, m,jon,  Because the enemy is real.  It's always been real.,4,7,9
6971,jon, m,jon,"  No, I don't think I can.",4,7,6
6972,jon, m,jon,"  My people won't accept a southern ruler, not after everything they've suffered.",4,7,12
6973,jon, m,jon,  I would never presume to --,4,7,6
6974,jon, m,jon,  I never thought that dragons would exist again.  No one did.  The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen.  Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen.  Build a world that's different from the shit one they've always known.,4,7,48
6975,jon, m,jon,"  But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different.  You're just more of the same.",4,7,20
6976,jon, m,jon,  Who?,4,7,1
6977,jon, m,jon,  I think she has a good heart.,4,7,7
6978,jon, m,jon,"  There's no time for that.  I saw the Night King, Davos.  I looked into his eyes.  How many men do we have in the north to fight him?  10,000?  Less?",4,7,30
6979,jon, m,jon,  What?,4,7,1
6980,jon, m,jon,  It doesn't matter.,4,7,3
6981,jon, m,jon,  Of course.,4,7,2
6982,jon, m,jon,  I'm a bastard.  My mother and father weren't married.,4,7,9
6983,jon, m,jon,  Why did you leave your homeland?,4,7,6
6984,jon, m,jon,  I'm sorry.,4,7,2
6985,jon, m,jon,  And if you wanted to sail home to Naarth tomorrow --,4,7,11
6986,jon, m,jon,  You believe that?,4,7,3
6987,jon, m,jon,  Is that a Greyjoy ship?,4,7,5
6988,jon, m,jon,  What you did for her is the only reason I'm not killing you.,4,7,13
6989,jon, m,jon,  The queen is gone.,4,7,4
6990,jon, m,jon,  Are you all right?,6,7,4
6991,jon, m,jon,  Ever been north before?,6,7,4
6992,jon, m,jon,  You've never been down south.,6,7,5
6993,jon, m,jon,  That's the north.,6,7,3
6994,jon, m,jon,  There's not another woman within 100 miles of here.,6,7,9
6995,jon, m,jon,  Davos says he is a strong fighter.,6,7,7
6996,jon, m,jon,  She'll only fight beside us if I bend the knee.,6,7,10
6997,jon, m,jon,  The first time I went north of the wall was with your father.,6,7,13
6998,jon, m,jon,  I was a prisoner of the Wildlings.  But we avenged him.  I want you to know that every mutineer found justice.,6,7,21
6999,jon, m,jon,  I hate that he died that way.  My father was the most honorable man I ever met.  He was good all the way through.  And he died on the executioner's block.,6,7,31
7000,jon, m,jon,  I heard.,6,7,2
7001,jon, m,jon,  I'm glad he didn't capture you.,6,7,6
7002,jon, m,jon,"  Your father gave me this sword.  He changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf, but it's still Long Claw.",6,7,21
7003,jon, m,jon,  Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros.,6,7,10
7004,jon, m,jon,  But you are back and it's been in your family for centuries.  It's not right for me to have it.,6,7,20
7005,jon, m,jon,  I'm not his son.,6,7,4
7006,jon, m,jon,  Who's that?,6,7,2
7007,jon, m,jon,  You knew him?,6,7,3
7008,jon, m,jon,  I serve the north.,6,7,4
7009,jon, m,jon,  The lord of light never spoke to me.  I don't know anything about him.  I don't know what he wants from me.,6,7,22
7010,jon, m,jon,  Why?,6,7,1
7011,jon, m,jon,"  That's all anyone can tell me, I don't know.  So what's the point in serving a god that none of us knows what he wants.",6,7,25
7012,jon, m,jon,  So what are you fighting for?,6,7,6
7013,jon, m,jon,  But we all die.,6,7,4
7014,jon, m,jon,"  ""I am the shield that guards the realms of men.""",6,7,10
7015,jon, m,jon,  Aye.  Maybe that's enough.,6,7,4
7016,jon, m,jon,  How many people live here?,7,7,5
7017,jon, m,jon, That's more people than the entire North crammed into that. Why would anyone want to live that way?,7,7,18
7018,jon, m,jon, This isn't about living in harmony. It's just about living. The same thing is coming for all of us. A general you can't negotiate with. An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield. Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city. They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead.,7,7,60
7019,jon, m,jon, This is serious. I wouldn't be here if it weren't.,7,7,10
7020,jon, m,jon,  We can destroy them by burning them.,7,7,7
7021,jon, m,jon," And we can destroy them with dragonglass. If we don't win this fight, then that is the fate of every person in the world.",7,7,24
7022,jon, m,jon, There is only one war that matters the Great War. And it is here.,7,7,14
7023,jon, m,jon, No.,7,7,1
7024,jon, m,jon, (SIGHS),7,7,1
7025,jon, m,jon, I am true to my word. Or I try to be. That is why I cannot give you what you ask. I cannot serve two queens. And I have already pledged myself to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.,7,7,38
7026,jon, m,jon, I know!,7,7,2
7027,jon, m,jon, I'm not going to swear an oath I can't uphold. Talk about my father.,7,7,14
7028,jon, m,jon, I did this. I should go.,7,7,6
7029,jon, m,jon, No one is less happy about this than I am.,7,7,10
7030,jon, m,jon, You're not like everyone else. And your family hasn't seen its end. You're still here.,7,7,15
7031,jon, m,jon, Who told you that?,7,7,4
7032,jon, m,jon, Has it occurred to you she might not have been a reliable source of information?,7,7,15
7033,jon, m,jon," So, what now?",7,7,3
7034,jon, m,jon, It appears Tyrion's assessment was correct. We're fucked.,7,7,8
7035,jon, m,jon," If we have the Dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad, they'll arrive at Winterfell within the fortnight.",7,7,17
7036,jon, m,jon," It's your decision, Your Grace. But if we're going to be allies in this war, it's important for the Northerners to see us as allies. If we sail to White Harbor together, I think it sends a better message.",7,7,39
7037,jon, m,jon, All right.,7,7,2
7038,jon, m,jon, We went down there to make peace. And it seems to me we need to be honest with each other if we're going to fight together.,7,7,26
7039,jon, m,jon," It's not. It may seem that way from the outside, but I promise you, it's not true. I've done plenty of things that I regret.",7,7,25
7040,jon, m,jon, No. Not compared to you.,7,7,5
7041,jon, m,jon, Our father was more of a father.,7,7,7
7042,jon, m,jon, And you betrayed him. Betrayed his memory.,7,7,7
7043,jon, m,jon, (SIGHS) But you never lost him. He's a part of you. Just like he's a part of me.,7,7,18
7044,jon, m,jon," It's not my place to forgive you for all of it. But what I can forgive, I do. You don't need to choose. You're a Greyjoy and you're a Stark.",7,7,30
7045,jon, m,jon," So, why are you still talking to me?",7,7,8
7046,jon, m,jon, We need every man we can get.,2,8,7
7047,jon, m,jon, I thought we'd lost you.,2,8,5
7048,jon, m,jon, How did you find each other?,2,8,6
7049,jon, m,jon, The Umbers?,2,8,2
7050,jon, m,jon, How long do we have?,2,8,5
7051,jon, m,jon, They're coming.,2,8,2
7052,jon, m,jon, We have dragonglass and Valyrian steel.,2,8,6
7053,jon, m,jon, But there are too many of them.,2,8,7
7054,jon, m,jon, Far too many.,2,8,3
7055,jon, m,jon, Our enemy doesn't tire.,2,8,4
7056,jon, m,jon, Doesn't stop. Doesn't feel.,2,8,4
7057,jon, m,jon, We can't beat them in a straight fight.,2,8,8
7058,jon, m,jon, The Night King made them all. They follow his command. If he falls Getting to him may be our best chance.,2,8,21
7059,jon, m,jon," We'll put you in the crypt, where it's safest.",2,8,9
7060,jon, m,jon," If they're in the field, they're not protecting Bran. We need to be near him. Not too near, or the Night King won't come. But close enough to pursue him when he does.",2,8,33
7061,jon, m,jon, Let's get some rest.,2,8,4
7062,jon, m,jon, Your Grace.,2,8,2

7070,jon, m,jon," They were married in secret. After Rhaegar fell on the Trident, she had a son. Robert would have murdered the baby if he ever found out, and Lyanna knew it. So the last thing she did, as she bled to death on her birthing bed, was give the boy to her brother, Ned Stark, to raise as his bastard.",2,8,59

7072,jon, m,jon, I wish it were.,2,8,4
7073,jon, m,jon, Bran. He saw it.,2,8,4
7074,jon, m,jon, And Samwell confirmed it. He read about their marriage at the Citadel without even knowing what it meant.,2,8,18
7075,jon, m,jon," It's true, Dany. I know it is.",2,8,7
7076,jon, m,jon, I warned you. Northerners don't much trust outsiders.,1,8,8

7081,jon, m,jon, We need to send ravens to the Night's Watch as well. There's no sense in manning the castles anymore. We make our stand here.,1,8,24
7082,jon, m,jon, It's not important.,1,8,3
7083,jon, m,jon," You did, my lady. It was the honor of my life. I’ll always be grateful for your faith. But when I left Winterfell, I told you we need allies or we will die. I have brought those allies home to fight alongside us. I had a choice, keep my crown or protect the North. I chose the North.",1,8,58
7084,jon, m,jon, How did you sneak up on me?,1,8,7
7085,jon, m,jon, I didn't.,1,8,2
7086,jon, m,jon, You still have it.,1,8,4

7093,jon, m,jon, Yeah. I'm her family too.,1,8,5

7095,jon, m,jon, What's the matter?,1,8,3
7096,jon, m,jon, What's wrong with them?,1,8,4

7106,jon, m,jon," Do you think we can beat the Army of the Dead without her? I fought them, Sansa. Twice. You want to worry about who holds what title, I'm telling you it doesn't matter. Without her, we don't stand a chance.",1,8,40

7110,jon, m,jon, Were you hiding from me?,1,8,5
7111,jon, m,jon, What are you doing in Winterfell? Or did you read every book in the Citadel already?,1,8,16
7112,jon, m,jon, What's wrong? Gilly? Is she all right?,1,8,7
7113,jon, m,jon, Little Sam?,1,8,2

7120,jon, m,jon, What are you talking about?,1,8,5
7121,jon, m,jon, My father was the most honorable man I ever met. You're saying he lied to me all my life.,1,8,19
7122,jon, m,jon, Daenerys is our queen.,1,8,4
7123,jon, m,jon, That's treason.,1,8,2
7124,jon, m,jon, We're here to say goodbye to our  brothers and sisters. To our fathers and mothers. To our friends. Our fellow men and women who set aside their differences to fight together and die together so that others might live. Everyone in this world owes them a debt that can never be repaid. It is our duty and our honor to keep them alive in memory for those who come after us and those who come after them for as long as men draw breath. They were the shields that guarded the realms of men. And we shall never see their like again.,4,8,102

7131,jon, m,jon, I told you I don't want it.,4,8,7
7132,jon, m,jon, I'll refuse. You are my queen. I don't know what else I can say.,4,8,14
7133,jon, m,jon, I have to tell Sansa and Arya.,4,8,7
7134,jon, m,jon, She won't.,4,8,2
7135,jon, m,jon, I owe them the truth.,4,8,5
7136,jon, m,jon, It won't.,4,8,2

7138,jon, m,jon, The Northmen as well.,4,8,4
7139,jon, m,jon," We'll surround the city. If the Iron Fleet tries to ferry in more food, the dragons will destroy them. If the Lannisters and the Golden Company attack, we'll defeat them in the field.",4,8,33
7140,jon, m,jon, (to SANSA and ARYA) The Northern forces will honor their promises and their allegiance to the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.,4,8,21
7141,jon, m,jon," What you command, we will obey.",4,8,6
7142,jon, m,jon, You understand we'd all be dead if not for her. We'd be corpses marching down to King's Landing.,4,8,18
7143,jon, m,jon, Her men gave their lives defending Winterfell--,4,8,7

7149,jon, m,jon, I need to tell you something. But you have to swear you'll never tell another soul.,4,8,16
7150,jon, m,jon," You have to swear it, before I tell you.",4,8,9
7151,jon, m,jon, Because we're family. Swear it.,4,8,5
7152,jon, m,jon, (to BRAN) Tell them.,4,8,4
7153,jon, m,jon, Just a horse. Rhaegal needs to heal. He doesn't need me weighing him down.,4,8,14
7154,jon, m,jon, (laughs),4,8,1
7155,jon, m,jon," This is the North, you know. And the Free Folk are welcome to stay.",4,8,14
7156,jon, m,jon, It's where he belongs too. A direwolf has no place in the south. Will you take him with you? He'll be happier up there.,4,8,24
7157,jon, m,jon," I wish I was going with you. This is farewell, then.",4,8,11
7158,jon, m,jon, I hope it's a girl.,4,8,5

7172,jon, m,jon, I can't justify what happened. I won't try. But the war is over now.,6,8,14
7173,jon, m,jon," And you've been by her side, counseling her. Until today.",6,8,10
7174,jon, m,jon," You think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we're born and that's who we are? Then I'd be fire and blood too. She's not her father, no more than you're Tywin Lannister.",6,8,35
7175,jon, m,jon, Cersei left her no choice.,6,8,5
7176,jon, m,jon, She saw her friend beheaded. She saw her dragon shot out of the sky.,6,8,14
7177,jon, m,jon," Ah, it's easy to judge when you're standing far from the battlefield.",6,8,12
7178,jon, m,jon, What?,6,8,1
7179,jon, m,jon, I don't know.,6,8,3

7185,jon, m,jon, I'm sorry it came to this.,6,8,6
7186,jon, m,jon, My sisters will be loyal to the throne.,6,8,8
7187,jon, m,jon,  She doesn't get to choose.,6,8,5

7322,jon, m,jon, Are you sure you want to do this?,4,1,8
7323,jon, m,jon,  I've had worse.,4,1,3
7324,jon, m,jon," It's not going to get any easier, you know? You'll have to defend yourself.",4,1,14
7325,jon, m,jon,  The Wall's no place for cowards.,4,1,6
7326,jon, m,jon, Come stand by the fire. It's warmer.,4,1,7
7327,jon, m,jon, You're not. You're freezing.,4,1,4
7328,jon, m,jon,"  You can't fight. You can't see. You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably. What are you doing here, Sam?",4,1,21
7329,jon, m,jon,"  Yes, he is.",4,1,3
7330,jon, m,jon,  Well… You can't get any worse.,4,1,6
7331,jon, m,jon, Watch duty. With Sam.,4,1,4
7332,jon, m,jon, He wasn't hungry.,4,1,3
7333,jon, m,jon," That's enough. Sam's no different from the rest of us. There was no place for him in the world, so he's come here. We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore. Never again, no matter what Thorne says. He's our brother now and we're going to protect him.",4,1,51
7334,jon, m,jon,  No one touches Sam.,4,1,4
7335,jon, m,jon, I wouldn't doubt it.,4,1,4
7336,jon, m,jon,  Sally on the side?,4,1,4
7337,jon, m,jon, I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.,4,1,9
7338,jon, m,jon,"  As a matter of fact, I'm the same as you.",4,1,10
7339,jon, m,jon,"  I came very close once. I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but...",4,1,16
7340,jon, m,jon,  I know where to put it.,4,1,6
7341,jon, m,jon,  Young and gorgeous. A whore named Ros.,4,1,7
7342,jon, m,jon, Red.,4,1,1
7343,jon, m,jon,  You don't want to know.,4,1,5
7344,jon, m,jon, Better.,4,1,1
7345,jon, m,jon,  What's my name?,4,1,3
7346,jon, m,jon,  And why is my surname Snow?,4,1,6
7347,jon, m,jon," I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child.",4,1,82
7348,jon, m,jon, I build my own fires.,4,1,5
7349,jon, m,jon,  Why is he alone?,7,1,4
7350,jon, m,jon,  There's no rider.,7,1,3
7351,jon, m,jon,  That's my Uncle Benjen's horse.,7,1,5
7352,jon, m,jon,  I want to find my Uncle.,7,1,6
7353,jon, m,jon,"  I do, my lord.",7,1,4
7354,jon, m,jon,"  Yes, my lord.",7,1,3
7355,jon, m,jon,  Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals and fetch hot water for his bath.,7,1,14
7356,jon, m,jon,  Do you take me for a servant?,7,1,7
7357,jon, m,jon,  May I go?,7,1,3
7358,jon, m,jon,"  I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all.",7,1,7
7359,jon, m,jon,"  I just, I always wanted to be a Ranger.",7,1,9
7360,jon, m,jon, You don’t have to be here.,9,6,6
7361,jon, m,jon, You’re right. There’s no need for a battle. Thousands of men don’t need to die. Only one of us. Let’s end this the old way. You against me.,9,6,28
7362,jon, m,jon," Aye, you have the numbers. Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn’t fight for them?",9,6,21
7363,jon, m,jon," If he was smart, he’d stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out.",9,6,15
7364,jon, m,jon," It’s his weakness, too. His mean don’t want to fight for him. They’re forced to fight for him. If they feel the tide turning...",9,6,24
7365,jon, m,jon," We’re digging trenches all along our flanks. They won’t be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you, in a double envelopment.",9,6,24
7366,jon, m,jon, A pincer move.,9,6,3
7367,jon, m,jon, They won’t be able to hit us from the sides.,9,6,10
7368,jon, m,jon, No. But I wanted to make him angry. I want him coming at us full tilt.,9,6,16
7369,jon, m,jon," Aye, for what they’re worth.",9,6,5
7370,jon, m,jon, You’re right.,9,6,2
7371,jon, m,jon, He’s overconfident.,9,6,2
7372,jon, m,jon," Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks? I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton. I’ve defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton.",9,6,32
7373,jon, m,jon," All right, tell me. What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?",9,6,14
7374,jon, m,jon, We can’t give up on our brother.,9,6,7
7375,jon, m,jon, Of course he does. What should I do differently?,9,6,9
7376,jon, m,jon," Aye, that’s good advice.",9,6,4
7377,jon, m,jon," Well, it is a bit obvious.",9,6,6
7378,jon, m,jon, When will we have a larger force?! We’ve pleaded with every house that’ll have us! The Blackfish can’t help us! We’re lucky to have this many men!,9,6,27
7379,jon, m,jon," Now, it’s not enough! It’s what we have! Battles have been won against greater odds.",9,6,15
7380,jon, m,jon, My lady. You weren’t at the war council.,9,6,8
7381,jon, m,jon, Any advice?,9,6,2
7382,jon, m,jon," If I do, if I fall, don’t bring me back.",9,6,10
7383,jon, m,jon, I’m ordering you not to bring me back.,9,6,8
7384,jon, m,jon, You’re in my camp. I’m the commander.,9,6,7
7385,jon, m,jon, How do you know what he commands?,9,6,7
7386,jon, m,jon, Why?,9,6,1
7387,jon, m,jon, What kind of god would do something like that?,9,6,9
7388,jon, m,jon, Get word --,9,6,3
7389,jon, m,jon, We’re going to bury my brother in the crypt next to my father.,9,6,13
7390,jon, m,jon," When we had feasts, our family would sit up here… and I’d sit down there.",10,6,15
7391,jon, m,jon," Aye, you’re right. I was luckier than most.",10,6,8
7392,jon, m,jon, What is that?,10,6,3
7393,jon, m,jon, Do you have anything to say for yourself?,10,6,8
7394,jon, m,jon," Ride south today. If you return to the North, I’ll have you hanged as a murderer.",10,6,16
7395,jon, m,jon, I’m having the lord’s chamber prepared for you.,10,6,8
7396,jon, m,jon, I’m not a Stark.,10,6,4
7397,jon, m,jon, You’re the Lady of Winterfell. You deserve it. We’re standing here because of you. The battle was lost until the Knights of the Vale rode in. They came because of you. You told me Lord Baelish sold you to the Boltons.,10,6,41
7398,jon, m,jon, And you trust him?,10,6,4
7399,jon, m,jon, We need to trust each other. We can’t fight a war amongst ourselves. We have so many enemies now.,10,6,19
7400,jon, m,jon," Well, Father always promised, didn’t he?",10,6,6
7401,jon, m,jon," The free folk, the northerners, and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely, fought together, and we won. My father uses to say we find our true friends on the battlefield.",10,6,31
7402,jon, m,jon," The war is not over. And I promise you, friend, the true enemy won’t wait out the storm. He brings the storm.",10,6,22
7403,jon, m,jon," There’s nothing to forgive, my lord.",10,6,6
7404,jon, m,jon, They stabbed me. Olly...he put a knife in my heart. I shouldn’t be here.,3,6,14
7405,jon, m,jon, Nothing. There was nothing at all.,3,6,6
7406,jon, m,jon, I did what I thought was right. And I got murdered for it. And now I’m back. Why?,3,6,18
7407,jon, m,jon," I don’t know how to do that. I thought I did, but...I failed.",3,6,13
7408,jon, m,jon, I’m not a god.,3,6,4
7409,jon, m,jon, I think so. Hold off on burning my body for now.,3,6,11
7410,jon, m,jon," If you have any last words, now is the time.",3,6,10
7411,jon, m,jon, Neither was killing me.,3,6,4
7412,jon, m,jon," I’m sure you would, Ser Alliser.",3,6,6
7413,jon, m,jon, You should.,3,6,2
7414,jon, m,jon, Wear it. Burn it. Whatever you want. You have Castle Black.,3,6,11
7415,jon, m,jon, My watch is ended.,3,6,4
7416,jon, m,jon," We can’t defend the north from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons. If we want to survive, we need Winterfell, and to take Winterfell, we need more men.",5,6,30
7417,jon, m,jon, How do you know that?,5,6,5
7418,jon, m,jon, New dress?,5,6,2
7419,jon, m,jon," Thank you, Sansa.",5,6,3
7420,jon, m,jon, Don’t knock it down while I’m gone.,5,6,7
7421,jon, m,jon, South.,4,6,1
7422,jon, m,jon, Get warm.,4,6,2
7423,jon, m,jon, I did everything I could. You know that.,4,6,8
7424,jon, m,jon," Aye, I pledged my life to the Night’s Watch. I gave my life.",4,6,13
7425,jon, m,jon," They killed me, Edd! My own brothers. You want me to stay here after that?",4,6,15
7426,jon, m,jon, With the peas and onions?,4,6,5
7427,jon, m,jon, We never should have left Winterfell.,4,6,6
7428,jon, m,jon, How could we know?,4,6,4
7429,jon, m,jon, We were children.,4,6,3
7430,jon, m,jon, You were occasionally awful. I’m sure I can’t have been great fun. Always sulking in the corner while the rest of you played.,4,6,23
7431,jon, m,jon, There’s nothing to forgive.,4,6,4
7432,jon, m,jon," All right. All right, I forgive you.",4,6,7
7433,jon, m,jon," You’d think after thousands of years, the Night’s Watch would have learned how to make a good ale.",4,6,18
7434,jon, m,jon," Where will we go? If I don’t watch over you, Father’s ghost will come back and murder me.",4,6,18
7435,jon, m,jon," I can’t stay here, not after what happened.",4,6,8
7436,jon, m,jon, Should we tell the Boltons to pack up and leave?,4,6,10
7437,jon, m,jon, I don’t have an army.,4,6,5
7438,jon, m,jon, They didn’t come here to serve me.,4,6,7
7439,jon, m,jon, Sansa.,4,6,1
7440,jon, m,jon, I’m tired of fighting.,4,6,4
7441,jon, m,jon, It’s all I’ve done since I left home. I’ve killed brothers of the Night’s Watch. I’ve killed wildlings. I’ve killed men that I admire. I hanged a boy younger than Bran. I fought and I lost.,4,6,36
7442,jon, m,jon, I’m not Lord Commander anymore.,4,6,5
7443,jon, m,jon," ""To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow. You allowed thousands of wildlings past the Wall. You have betrayed your own kind. You have betrayed the North. Winterfell is mine, bastard. Come and see. Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon.",4,6,40
7444,jon, m,jon," His direwolf's skin is on my floor. Come and see. I want my bride back. Send her to me, bastard, and I will not trouble you or your wildling lovers. Keep her from me and I will ride north and slaughter every wildling man, woman, and babe living under your protection. You will watch as I skin them living. You --",4,6,61
7445,jon, m,jon, It's just more of the same.,4,6,6
7446,jon, m,jon, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.,4,6,8
7447,jon, m,jon, We don’t know that.,4,6,4
7448,jon, m,jon, How many do you have?,4,6,5
7449,jon, m,jon," That’s what’ll happen to you if we lose. The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you’re here. They know that more than half of you are women and children. After they finish with me, they’ll come for you. You’re right. This isn’t your fight. You shouldn’t have to come to Winterfell with me. I shouldn’t be asking you. It’s not the deal we made. I need you with me if we’re gonna beat them, and we need to beat them if you’re going to survive.",7,6,86
7450,jon, m,jon, Are you sure they’ll come?,7,6,5
7451,jon, m,jon, Lady Mormont.,7,6,2
7452,jon, m,jon," Robb is gone, but House Stark is not. And it needs your support now more than ever. I’ve come with my sister to ask for House Mormont’s allegiance.",7,6,28
7453,jon, m,jon, Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men. I fought them at Hardhome. We both lost.,7,6,19
7454,jon, m,jon," Thank you, my lady. How many fighting men can we expect?",7,6,11
7455,jon, m,jon, 62?,7,6,1
7456,jon, m,jon," Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out.",7,6,9
7457,jon, m,jon, House Mormont.,7,6,2
7458,jon, m,jon, The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings.,7,6,10
7459,jon, m,jon, Lord Glover.,7,6,2
7460,jon, m,jon, We’re not staying here long. Another storm could hit any day..,7,6,11
7461,jon, m,jon, We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can.,7,6,11
7462,jon, m,jon, Ser Davos is the reason I’m standing here talking to you and he served Stannis for years.,7,6,17
7463,jon, m,jon, There’s no time.,7,6,3
7464,jon, m,jon, We fight with the army we have.,7,6,7
7465,euron, m,euron,  This is the life.  Look at them.  Cheering for a Greyjoy.,3,7,11
7466,euron, m,euron,"  I have to be honest, it's making me hard.  Did you see little Theon's face right before he jumped overboard?",3,7,20
7467,euron, m,euron,  Oh no!,3,7,2
7468,euron, m,euron,  What a twat.,3,7,3
7469,euron, m,euron,  My queen.  Please accept this gift on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the Iron Islands.,3,7,18
7470,euron, m,euron,  I give you --,3,7,4
7471,euron, m,euron,  A bit more than a true friend.,3,7,7
7472,euron, m,euron,  There's only one reward I want.,3,7,6
7473,euron, m,euron,"  There's nothing quite like it, is there?  The love of the people.  I suppose you wouldn't know.",3,7,17
7474,euron, m,euron,"  Or yours.  They just like severed heads really.  Listen, if you have any advice at all I'd love to hear it when we have an hour or two to speak as brothers.",3,7,32
7475,euron, m,euron,  Does she like it gentle or rough?  A finger in the bum?,3,7,12
7476,euron, m,euron,"  Shhh, shhh, shhh, not now.  We'll talk later.",3,7,8
7477,euron, m,euron,  Give your uncle a kiss.,2,7,5
7478,euron, m,euron,  Theon!,2,7,1
7479,euron, m,euron,"  Ah, come on your cockless hound.  I have her.  Come and get her.",2,7,13
7480,euron, m,euron," The moment I was chosen Lord of the Iron Islands, they turned on me. Their own uncle. They stole my best ships and ran. Sailed the right across the world and gave them to the Dragon Queen so she could bring her armies here to attack you.",1,7,47
7481,euron, m,euron," It's nothing compares to the treason you suffered at the hands of a family members, from what I hear. But still, it bothers me. Murdering them would make me feel a lot better. And since it appears that all our treasonous family members are fighting for the same side, I thought we rightful monarchs could murder them together.",1,7,58
7482,euron, m,euron," I remember very well. I saw you. I heard so much talk. The best in the world. No one can stop him. I didn't believe it, to be honesty. But I must say, when you rushed through the breach and started cutting people down...it was glorious. Like a dance.",1,7,49
7483,euron, m,euron, The place was getting crowded. I enjoyed watching it. I truly did.,1,7,12
7484,euron, m,euron," A good thing for me. If you hadn't crushed us, I wouldn't have gone into exile. If I hadn't done that, I wouldn't be the greatest captain on the 14 seas.",1,7,31
7485,euron, m,euron," You're not humble. You're the queen of a great nation. You don't care about the Iron Islands. They're nothing but rocks and bird shit and--and a lot of very unattractive people. The Iron Fleet, on the other hand, that's something else entirely. It's the greatest armada Westeros has ever seen. With the Iron Fleet, you own the seas. You can defeat the invaders of the east and the pretenders of the north and south.",1,7,74
7486,euron, m,euron," Ever since I was a little boy, I wanted to grow up and mary the most beautiful woman in the world. So here I am, with a thousand ships and two good hands.",1,7,33
7487,euron, m,euron, Why?,1,7,1
7488,euron, m,euron, You should try it. Feels wonderful.,1,7,6
7489,euron, m,euron," I don't expect you to trust me outright. You need proof of my honest intentions. In my experience, the surest way to a woman's heart is with a gift. A priceless gift. I won't return to King's Landing until I have that for you.",1,7,44
7490,euron, m,euron, Theon! I have your sister,7,7,5
7491,euron, m,euron, Then why are you talking? You're the smallest concern here.,7,7,10
7492,euron, m,euron," We don't even let your kind live in the Iron Islands, you know? We kill you at birth. An act of mercy for the parents.",7,7,25
7493,euron, m,euron, Why?,7,7,1
7494,euron, m,euron, Can they swim?,7,7,3
7495,euron, m,euron, Good. I'm taking the Iron Fleet back to the Iron Islands.,7,7,11
7496,euron, m,euron," I've been around the world. I've seen everything, things you couldn't imagine, and this this is the only thing I've ever seen that terrifies me.",7,7,25
7497,euron, m,euron," I'm going back to my island. You should go back to yours. When winter's over, we'll be the only ones left alive.",7,7,22
7498,euron, m,euron, But we're family. The last Greyjoys left in the world. The last ones with balls anyway.,1,8,16
7499,euron, m,euron, If I kill you who can I talk to? Hmm?,1,8,10
7500,euron, m,euron, I've got a crew full of mutes. It gets lonely at sea.,1,8,12
7501,euron, m,euron, Mm.,1,8,1
7502,euron, m,euron, Then I'll sail the Iron Fleet somewhere else.,1,8,8
7503,euron, m,euron, But first I'm gonna fuck the queen.,1,8,7
7504,euron, m,euron, They cheated at dice. Or maybe I cheated. Someone cheated. They weren't good fighters. You won't miss them.,1,8,18
7505,euron, m,euron, Am I most welcome here?,1,8,5
7506,euron, m,euron, Good. As a true friend and an honored guest,1,8,9
7507,euron, m,euron, I was hoping we could talk in private.,1,8,8
7508,euron, m,euron, Wars sometimes last years.,1,8,4
7509,euron, m,euron, How?,1,8,1
7510,euron, m,euron," I've given her justice, an army and the Iron Fleet, yet she gives me no sign of affection. My heart is nearly broken.",1,8,23
7511,euron, m,euron, They were lesser men.,1,8,4
7512,euron, m,euron," So, how do I compare to the fat king?",1,8,9
7513,euron, m,euron, Are you offended?,1,8,3
7514,euron, m,euron, And the Kingslayer?,1,8,3
7515,euron, m,euron, Life is boring.,1,8,3
7516,euron, m,euron, Do I please the queen?,1,8,5
7517,euron, m,euron, I'm going to put a prince in your belly.,1,8,9
7518,euron, m,euron," The glory is yours, my queen.",4,8,6
7519,euron, m,euron, She's coming for you.,4,8,4
7520,euron, m,euron, What is dead may never die.,2,6,6
7521,euron, m,euron, Has the custom changed since I’ve been gone? Aren’t you supposed to repeat the words?,2,6,15
7522,euron, m,euron," I don’t mock the Drowned God. I am the Drowned God. From Oldtown to Qarth, when men see my sails, they pray.",2,6,22
7523,euron, m,euron," You’re old, brother. You've had your time. Now let another rule.",2,6,11
7524,euron, m,euron, They did.,2,6,2
7525,euron, m,euron, I needed silence.,2,6,3
7526,euron, m,euron," I am the storm, brother. The first storm and the last. And you’re in my way.",2,6,16
7527,euron, m,euron, I’m Euron Greyjoy.,5,6,3
7528,euron, m,euron, I claim the Salt Throne.,5,6,5
7529,euron, m,euron, Niece.,5,6,1
7530,euron, m,euron, Nephew. Little Theon.,5,6,3
7531,euron, m,euron, Heard you managed to fuck things right into the ground. Captured a castle you couldn’t keep. Got yourself taken prisoner. Even heard you have no cock.,5,6,26
7532,euron, m,euron, Explains why you think a woman can be king.,5,6,9
7533,euron, m,euron, A few days ago. I had some things to take care of. Long overdue.,5,6,14
7534,euron, m,euron, I did. I killed him. Threw him right over a rope bridge and watched him fall. He was leading us nowhere and we would still be heading there if it weren’t for me. No one loved him. No one wanted to follow him. He led ius into two wars we couldn’t win. I apologize to you all for not killing him years ago.,5,6,63
7535,euron, m,euron, Gallivanting? That the sort of thing you start to say once your dick gets chopped off?,5,6,16
7536,euron, m,euron, Did the great lord of Westeros teach you words like that?,5,6,11
7537,euron, m,euron, And how will she do that?,5,6,6
7538,euron, m,euron," Right idea, except I’m the one who’s going to build the Iron Fleet because I’m the one who knows how to use it. I’ve been all over the world. I’ve seen more of it than all of you combined. And across the sea there is a person who hates the great lords of Westeros just as much as we do. Someone with a large army, three large dragons, and no husband. I’m going to build that fleet and I’m going to gallivant right over and give it to Daenerys Targaryen along with my big cock.",5,6,95
7539,euron, m,euron, I’m not going to seduce her. The Iron Fleet will seduce her. And together we’re going to take the Seven Kingdoms. I wasn’t born to be king. I paid the iron price and here I stand.,5,6,36
7540,euron, m,euron, Where are my niece and nephew? Let’s go murder them.,5,6,10
7541,euron, m,euron, Won’t be enough to save them.,5,6,6
7542,euron, m,euron, Go back to your homes. Chop down every tree you can find. Quarter-saw the timber and start building. I want every man bending planks. I want every woman spinning flax for sails. Build me a thousand ships and I will give you this world.,5,6,44

7590,margaery, f,margaery," You look radiant, Your Grace.",8,3,5
7591,margaery, f,margaery,  It's the word that came to mind.,8,3,7
7592,margaery, f,margaery, We're going to be sisters soon. We should be friends.,8,3,10
7593,margaery, f,margaery," A better dancer than a singer, I'm afraid.",8,3,8
7594,margaery, f,margaery,  Of course. They play it so often here at court.,8,3,10
7595,margaery, f,margaery,"  Not as well as you, I'm sure.",8,3,7
7596,margaery, f,margaery, (nods),8,3,1
7597,margaery, f,margaery,  Gone.,8,3,1
7598,margaery, f,margaery, (to a maid)  It's more your color. You take it.,2,3,10
7599,margaery, f,margaery, (to LORAS) You're such a dear.,2,3,6
7600,margaery, f,margaery," Come. Lady Sansa, it is my honor to present my grandmother the Lady Olenna of House Tyrell.",2,3,17
7601,margaery, f,margaery," Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother. Father liked him and so did Loras.",2,3,13
7602,margaery, f,margaery, Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us?,2,3,7
7603,margaery, f,margaery,  I'm to be his wife. I only want to know what that means.,2,3,13
7604,margaery, f,margaery," She's terrified, Grandmother. Just look at her.",2,3,7
7605,margaery, f,margaery," You wanted to see me, Your Grace?",2,3,7
7606,margaery, f,margaery," That's very thoughtful, Your Grace. I have everything I could want.",2,3,11
7607,margaery, f,margaery, A welcome one. A military encampment is no place for a lady.,2,3,12
7608,margaery, f,margaery," Your Grace, I tried to do my duty as a wife, that is all.",2,3,14
7609,margaery, f,margaery, The duty of any wife to any husband-to provide him with children.,2,3,12
7610,margaery, f,margaery," Why? I-I would not speak ill of the dead, Your Grace.",2,3,11
7611,margaery, f,margaery, No. I do beg your pardon. The subtleties of politics are often lost on me. Renly I don't believe he was interested in the company of women.,2,3,27
7612,margaery, f,margaery," Whenever I wanted to make a child with him, he-he had so many excuses, so many late-night war councils. He never wanted to try. Except one evening, after he'd had far too much wine to drink, he suggested something-something that sounded very painful and couldn't possibly result in children. Maybe the fault was with me.",2,3,55
7613,margaery, f,margaery," It's such a relief to hear you say so, Your Grace.",2,3,11
7614,margaery, f,margaery, As is your right. You must do whatever you need to do.,2,3,12
7615,margaery, f,margaery, You are the king.,2,3,4
7616,margaery, f,margaery, It's beautiful. Will you show me how it works?,2,3,9
7617,margaery, f,margaery," Would you take me hunting sometime? Forgive me, Your Grace. I know a hunt is no place for a woman.",2,3,20
7618,margaery, f,margaery,  May I? Please.,2,3,3
7619,margaery, f,margaery, I imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and watch something die over there.,2,3,18
7620,margaery, f,margaery,"  I don't know, Your Grace Do you think I could?",2,3,10
7621,margaery, f,margaery, Would you like to watch me?,2,3,6
7622,margaery, f,margaery, Why?,1,3,1
7623,margaery, f,margaery, Pardon me.,1,3,2
7624,margaery, f,margaery, I have others.,1,3,3
7625,margaery, f,margaery, And your mother?,1,3,3
7626,margaery, f,margaery," Bad men wanted to come into this city and do terrible things, but your father stopped them.",1,3,17
7627,margaery, f,margaery," Whenever you look at this knight, I want you to remember your father.",1,3,13
7628,margaery, f,margaery, And what do knights swear to do? Protect the weak and uphold the good. Your father did that. Be proud of him.,1,3,22
7629,margaery, f,margaery," Was your father a soldier, too?",1,3,6
7630,margaery, f,margaery,"  You should be proud, too. Under King Joffrey's leadership, your fathers saved the city. They saved us all. From now on, we're going to take care of you. All of you.",1,3,31
7631,margaery, f,margaery," Come to me for whatever you need to feed them, clothe them, or house them. Directly to me.",1,3,18
7632,margaery, f,margaery, Your Grace.,1,3,2
7633,margaery, f,margaery, ( laughs ),1,3,3
7634,margaery, f,margaery," The climate is a bit more forgiving back in Highgarden, Your Grace.",1,3,12
7635,margaery, f,margaery," I am touched by your concern, Your Grace. Luckily for us Tyrells, our blood runs quite warm. Doesn't it, Loras?",1,3,20
7636,margaery, f,margaery," Loras, isn't the queen's gown magnificent? The fabric, the embroidery, the metalwork. I've never seen anything like it.",1,3,18
7637,margaery, f,margaery, Yes. I paid a visit to an orphanage the High Septon told me about.,1,3,14
7638,margaery, f,margaery, The lowest among us are no different from the highest if you give them a chance and approach them with an open heart.,1,3,23
7639,margaery, f,margaery," Hunger turns men into beasts. I'm glad House Tyrell has been able to help in this regard. They tell me 100 wagons arrive daily now from the Reach. Wheat, barley, apples. We've had a blessed harvest. And, of course, it's our duty to assist the capital in time of need.",1,3,50
7640,margaery, f,margaery,  I'll plant the seed as soon as Joffrey and I are married. It should grow quickly.,5,3,16
7641,margaery, f,margaery, And only one to let you go. Because it will please me.,5,3,12
7642,margaery, f,margaery, (laughs),4,3,1
7643,margaery, f,margaery," Oh, no, it's quite all right, Your Grace. I'd love to see their tombs, really. It's like taking a walk through history.",4,3,22
7644,margaery, f,margaery, This is so exciting.,4,3,4
7645,margaery, f,margaery, (laughs),4,3,1
7646,margaery, f,margaery," I'm glad he did. I'm sorry, Your Grace. I know they did terrible things at the end, but their ancestors built this. Sometimes severity is the price we pay for greatness.",4,3,31
7647,margaery, f,margaery," Shall we go and see them? If you give them your love, they will return it a thousandfold. I've spoken with them. I know how they feel about you. You led the defense of King's Landing. They adore you.",4,3,39
7648,margaery, f,margaery, Ahem. I didn't mean to disturb you.,4,3,7
7649,margaery, f,margaery," We'd like some privacy, please. If you wouldn't mind waiting back inside the keep. Or if you'd be kind enough to give me your names, I'll ask the king to speak with you himself.",4,3,34
7650,margaery, f,margaery, What did you pray for?,4,3,5
7651,margaery, f,margaery," Why not? I'll tell you what I prayed for in the sept this morning. Let's see, for my family's health and happiness, for an end to the war, for a short winter. Boring and traditional, I'm afraid. And you?",4,3,39
7652,margaery, f,margaery," My cousin Alanna was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen. When I was 12, I was all elbows and knees and Alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture me. Pig-face, she called me.",4,3,35
7653,margaery, f,margaery," I think it had something to do with my nose. Whenever she passed me in the halls, she'd oink.",4,3,19
7654,margaery, f,margaery," So I prayed that she'd catch a horrible skin disease. A week after that, she came down with porridge plague.",4,3,20
7655,margaery, f,margaery, You don't have it in the North? Your skin starts to look like boiled oats and eventually your face slides off and you die in agony.,4,3,26
7656,margaery, f,margaery," (nods, laughs)",4,3,2
7657,margaery, f,margaery," Don't say that. No, you're not.",4,3,6
7658,margaery, f,margaery," Oh, she grew up to be the most beautiful woman and married a handsome lord and they have darling children and live in a castle by the sea. It's all terribly frustrating.",4,3,32
7659,margaery, f,margaery," I want us to be friends, good friends.",4,3,8
7660,margaery, f,margaery, You must see Highgarden. You'd love it there. I know you would. We have a great masquerade the night of the harvest moon. You should see the costumes. People work on them for months.,4,3,34
7661,margaery, f,margaery," The Queen Regent, you mean. Once I marry Joffrey, I'll be queen. And if you were to marry Loras. . .  Oh, your place would be at Highgarden, wouldn't it? We would be sisters, you and I. Would you like that?",4,3,41
7662,margaery, f,margaery, Come on. Come walk with me.,7,3,6
7663,margaery, f,margaery," I remember the first time I saw you in the throne room. I'd never seen anyone who looked so unhappy. I want very much for you to be happy, Sansa, and so does my grandmother.",7,3,35
7664,margaery, f,margaery, You would have been happy at Highgarden. But women in our position must make the best of our circumstances.,7,3,19
7665,margaery, f,margaery, Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you?,7,3,5
7666,margaery, f,margaery, Has he been kind to you?,7,3,6
7667,margaery, f,margaery," You don't want him, though.",7,3,5
7668,margaery, f,margaery," Far from the worst Lannister, wouldn't you say?",7,3,8
7669,margaery, f,margaery," My son will be king Sons learn from their mothers. I plan to teach mine a great deal. And your son, if I'm not mistaken, your son might be the Lord of Casterly Rock and the North someday. What?",7,3,39
7670,margaery, f,margaery, If it's the pain you're worried about--,7,3,7
7671,margaery, f,margaery," What is it, then? He's rather good-looking even with the scar. Especially with the scar.",7,3,15
7672,margaery, f,margaery," Some women like tall men. Some like short men. Some like hairy men. Some like bald men. Gentle men, rough men, ugly men, pretty men, pretty girls. Most women don't know what they like until they've tried it. And, sadly, so many of us get to try so little before we're old and gray. Tyrion may surprise you. From what I've heard, he's quite experienced.",7,3,65
7673,margaery, f,margaery,"  It can be. We're very complicated, you know. Pleasing us takes practice.",7,3,12
7674,margaery, f,margaery,"  Yes, sweet girl. My mother taught me.",7,3,7
7675,margaery, f,margaery, So am I the queen?,3,4,5
7676,margaery, f,margaery," Clawing at his own throat, looking to his mother to make stop... it was horrible.",3,4,15
7677,margaery, f,margaery, What was it like?,3,4,4
7678,margaery, f,margaery, One of my husbands preferred the company of men and was stabbed through the heart. Another was happiest torturing animals and was poisoned at our wedding feast... I must be cursed.,3,4,31
7679,margaery, f,margaery, But I would have been the queen.,3,4,7
7680,margaery, f,margaery," We are so fortunate to enjoy this marvelous food and drink. Not all among us are so lucky. To thank the gods for bringing the recent war to a just end, King Joffrey has decreed that the leftovers from our feast be given to the poorest in his city.",2,4,49
7681,margaery, f,margaery,  Lady Brienne. So good of you to come.,2,4,8
7682,margaery, f,margaery," That's not true, my love. Brienne had nothing to do with it.",2,4,12
7683,margaery, f,margaery, Thank you. I hope we see more of you.,2,4,9
7684,margaery, f,margaery," My love, come back to me. It's time for my father's toast.",2,4,12
7685,margaery, f,margaery," (Standing) Look, the pie.",2,4,4
7686,margaery, f,margaery, Wonderful. Wonderful. My hero.,2,4,4
7687,margaery, f,margaery, He's choking!,2,4,2
7688,margaery, f,margaery," The wedding is in a fortnight, Grandmother. You can't say no to everything.",1,4,13
7689,margaery, f,margaery, Perhaps I should just let Joffrey choose it for me. End up with a string of dead sparrow heads around my neck.,1,4,22
7690,margaery, f,margaery, A shadow?,1,4,2
7691,margaery, f,margaery, Joffrey is our king now.,1,4,5
7692,margaery, f,margaery, And you've given none.,1,4,4
7693,margaery, f,margaery, Your Grace.,5,4,2
7694,margaery, f,margaery,  Long may he reign.,5,4,4
7695,margaery, f,margaery,  He sits the throne like he was born to it.,5,4,10
7696,margaery, f,margaery," No, he wasn't.",5,4,3
7697,margaery, f,margaery, He was my husband. My king.,5,4,6
7698,margaery, f,margaery," Your Grace, I feel...",5,4,4
7699,margaery, f,margaery, No.,5,4,1
7700,margaery, f,margaery,"  It would be some consolation, wouldn't it? For all the horror that put him there.",5,4,15
7701,margaery, f,margaery, He has you.,5,4,3
7702,margaery, f,margaery," Oh. After all that's happened... it sounds strange, I know, but I am... I haven't even given any thought to it, what comes next. It would be a great honor, of course. But I will have to speak to my father about it.",5,4,43
7703,margaery, f,margaery,  We may be faced with an alarming number of weddings soon.,5,4,11
7704,margaery, f,margaery, I won't even know what to call you. Sister? Or Mother? Hmm.,5,4,12
7705,margaery, f,margaery, I can't believe you're going. Leaving me alone here with these people.,4,4,12
7706,margaery, f,margaery, (laughs),4,4,1
7707,margaery, f,margaery, No. Have they even agreed to the match? No one tells me anything.,4,4,13
7708,margaery, f,margaery, (laughs),4,4,1
7709,margaery, f,margaery, Mm-hmm.,4,4,1
7710,margaery, f,margaery, (laughs),4,4,1
7711,margaery, f,margaery," Well, he could have done.",4,4,5
7712,margaery, f,margaery," You don't know, Grandmother.",4,4,4
7713,margaery, f,margaery, What? I don't understand.,4,4,4
7714,margaery, f,margaery, Kingsguard.,4,4,1
7715,margaery, f,margaery,"  I'm not a visitor, Your Grace. Word has itI'm to be your bride.",4,4,13
7716,margaery, f,margaery," Did you know that people in arranged marriages often never meet until their wedding day? Before we decide to spend our lives together, we ought to get to know one another. Don't you think?",4,4,34
7717,margaery, f,margaery," It can be our secret. Hmm? If we're going to be man and wife, we'll have a few secrets from her, I hope. So, Your Grace...",4,4,26
7718,margaery, f,margaery, Hello. Aren't you a proper fellow?,4,4,6
7719,margaery, f,margaery, Very handsome.,4,4,2
7720,margaery, f,margaery, That's very cruel. You don't strike me as cruel.,4,4,9
7721,margaery, f,margaery, That's a relief. Because you know what happens when we marry?,4,4,11
7722,margaery, f,margaery," When we marry, I become yours. Forever. It's getting late. I should go. May I come and visit you again? All right, then.",4,4,23
7723,margaery, f,margaery,"  Remember, our little secret.",4,4,4
7724,margaery, f,margaery, No. You were lovely.,3,5,4
7725,margaery, f,margaery, Yes. (Chuckles).,3,5,2
7726,margaery, f,margaery," No, no, no. You're very sweet. The sweetest king who ever lived.",3,5,12
7727,margaery, f,margaery," Wouldn't that be glorious? (They laugh. Tommen leans in to kiss her). Shouldn't we rest a little while? Just to catch our breath, there's no rush, is there?",3,5,28
7728,margaery, f,margaery," No, I'm fine. I just want you all to myself. I want to know everything there is to know about King Tommen First of His Name.",3,5,26
7729,margaery, f,margaery, So strange… Husband.,3,5,3
7730,margaery, f,margaery," I understand. But it's not your fault, you know that, don't you? You mustn't feel guilty.",3,5,16
7731,margaery, f,margaery, (Sits up). I love to sail.,3,5,6
7732,margaery, f,margaery," I think we're going to be very happy, you and I.",3,5,11
7733,margaery, f,margaery," Living in a tower so high, it touches the clouds. Of course my grandmother couldn't wait to go home. The capital is not for everyone, I suppose. Does your mother like it here?",3,5,33
7734,margaery, f,margaery, It's so wonderful to have her watching over you. A lioness guiding her cub. (Pours them some wine).,3,5,18
7735,margaery, f,margaery, You are. And the king. (Hands him win). But you'll always be her baby-boy.,3,5,14
7736,margaery, f,margaery," I adore how she has always been so generous with me, so kind. And the horror she's had to injure. (Sits down and begins to comb her hair). Losing her husband, her eldest child and her father. It's no wonder she's so protective of you. She'll never let you out of her sight.",3,5,53
7737,margaery, f,margaery," I said, ""Darling, surely 4 times is enough, are you trying to set a new record?"" (Laugher). And he said, ""Well, what is the record? I'm sure we can break it.""",3,5,31
7738,margaery, f,margaery, Mother! (Gets up and hugs Cersei). Welcome.,3,5,7
7739,margaery, f,margaery, Can we bring you anything to eat or drink? I wish we had some wine for you. It's a bit early in the day for us.,3,5,26
7740,margaery, f,margaery, You are very sweet.,3,5,4
7741,margaery, f,margaery, I absolutely adore him. You raised a gallant young man. I'm forever grateful.,3,5,13

7756,margaery, f,margaery, Why is my brother in a cell?,4,5,7
7757,margaery, f,margaery, We both know who did. (Walks away). You told me she was returning to Casterly Rock.,4,5,16
7758,margaery, f,margaery, She's jealous you're not hers anymore. Arresting my brother is her revenge.,4,5,12

7761,margaery, f,margaery, Do you promise?,4,5,3
7762,margaery, f,margaery," You're the King of the Andals, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, the Protector of the Realm. And you let a band of fanatics imprison your brother by law.",4,5,29

7791,margaery, f,margaery, Do you want my brother to come in and help?,3,2,10
7792,margaery, f,margaery, He could get you started. I know he wouldn't mind. Or I can turn over and you can pretend I'm him.,3,2,21
7793,margaery, f,margaery, There's no need for us to play games. Save your lies for court. You're going to need a lot of them.,3,2,21
7794,margaery, f,margaery," Your enemies aren't happy about us. They want to tear us apart. And the best way to stop them is to put your baby in my belly. We can try again later. You decide how you want to do it, with me, with me and Loras, however else you like. Whatever you need to do. You are a king.",3,2,59
7795,margaery, f,margaery, We need to go home. Loras.,5,2,6

7803,margaery, f,margaery, Lord Baelish.,4,2,2
7804,margaery, f,margaery," It would be my pleasure. It took me weeks to learn my way around the camp. Twice I walked in on officers in stages of undress. And the moment I learn which tent is mine, we're on the move again.",4,2,40

7808,margaery, f,margaery," You've never married, have you?",4,2,5
7809,margaery, f,margaery," That is sad. Though perhaps it's for the best. The whole notion of marriage seems to confuse you, so allow me to explain. My husband is my king, and my king is my husband. Here is your tent, Lord Baelish. Good night.",4,2,42

7815,margaery, f,margaery," Forget about the bloody gods and listen to what I’m telling you. Cersei understands the consequences of her absence and she is absent anyway, which means she does not intend to suffer those consequences. The trial can wait. We all need to leave.",10,6,43
7816,margaery, f,margaery, We all need to leave now!,10,6,6
7817,margaery, f,margaery, Loras. Stay with me.,10,6,4

7841,margaery, f,margaery, You think I’m mad. I sound mad.,6,6,7
7842,margaery, f,margaery, He is. There’s something about him. His way of looking at the world. It’s not an easy thing admitting to yourself what you really are. It’s taken me a while. He’s helped me.,6,6,33
7843,margaery, f,margaery," Ah, yes, I visited their hovels and I fed them soup and I made sure I was seen doing it. I never gave them what they really needed, though.

7975,brienne, f,brienne, Didn't they teach you how to ride a horse?,5,4,9
7976,brienne, f,brienne," Perhaps you should have stayed with him. It's not going to be a pleasant journey for you. It could take weeks to get to the Wall, depending on the weather.",5,4,30
7977,brienne, f,brienne,"Well, Lady Sansa's brother's at Castle Black. If I were her, that's where I'd go. Feel free to stop at any point.",5,4,22

7987,brienne, f,brienne, What exactly did you do for Lord Tyrion?,5,4,8
7988,brienne, f,brienne," Oh. Whilst in Lord Tyrion's service, did you ever do anything remotely related to combat?",5,4,15
7989,brienne, f,brienne, Who?,5,4,1
7990,brienne, f,brienne, How did you kill a Kingsguard?,5,4,6

8007,brienne, f,brienne, What?,7,4,1
8008,brienne, f,brienne,  You wouldn't be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing.,7,4,13

8021,brienne, f,brienne, I do not fight for the Boltons. I’m Brienne of Tarth. I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon. I was there when he was murdered by a shadow with your face. You murdered him? With blood magic?,10,5,36

8023,brienne, f,brienne, We don't. We go around. (She turns her horse and begins leaving).,3,5,12
8024,brienne, f,brienne, Doesn't matter. I know where they're going.,3,5,7
8025,brienne, f,brienne, Aren't you getting a bit old to be a squire? How did you end up squiring for the Imp?,3,5,19
8026,brienne, f,brienne," Well, he's not here to complain about it, is he?",3,5,10
8027,brienne, f,brienne, He borrowed it?,3,5,3

8035,brienne, f,brienne, He was.,3,5,2
8036,brienne, f,brienne," (After a few moments). When I was a girl, my father held a ball. I'm his only living child, so he wants to make a good match for me. He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth. I didn't want to go, but he dragged me to the ballroom. (Pauses). And it was wonderful. None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was. The shoved each other, and threatened to duel if they thought it was their turn to dance. And whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles. (Smiles). My father smiled at me and I smiled at him. I'd never been so happy. (Her smile drops). Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering. And then they all started to laugh, they couldn't keep the game going any longer. They were toying with me. ‘Brienne the Beauty’, they called me. Great joke. And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive. A great lumbering beast. I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms. “Don't let them see your tears,” he told me. “They’re nasty little shits. The nasty little shits aren't worth crying over.” He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word. And he was the king's brother after all.",3,5,225
8037,brienne, f,brienne," Yes, Pod, he liked men, I'm not an idiot. He didn't love me, he didn't want me, he danced with me because he was kind and he wouldn't see me hurt. He saved me from being a joke. From that day until his last day. And I couldn't save him in return. Nothing's more hateful than failing to protect the one you love. One day, I will avenge King Renly.",3,5,70
8038,brienne, f,brienne," A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I know it was Stannis. I know it in my heart. Stannis is a man, not a shadow. And a man can be killed.",3,5,32

8050,brienne, f,brienne, He was murdered by a shadow. A shadow with a face of Stannis Baratheon.,2,5,14

8058,brienne, f,brienne, You can stand now.,2,5,4

8060,brienne, f,brienne, I swore to their mother I’d protect those girls.,2,5,9
8061,brienne, f,brienne, Do you think she’s safe from Littlefinger?,2,5,7
8062,brienne, f,brienne, Get your horse.,2,5,3
8063,brienne, f,brienne, Us? The only reason you’re here is that Jaime Lannister told me you weren’t safe in the capital. You’re hundreds of miles from King’s Landing. No one knows what you look like. No one cares. You’re safe.,1,5,37
8064,brienne, f,brienne, Do you even know what a squire is?,1,5,8
8065,brienne, f,brienne, I’m not a knight. That means you’re not a squire.,1,5,10
8066,brienne, f,brienne," I don’t care, I’m not your mother.",1,5,7
8067,brienne, f,brienne, I found Arya. She didn’t want my protection.,1,5,8
8068,brienne, f,brienne, Will you shut your mouth? I didn’t ask for advice. I don’t want anyone following me. I’m not a leader. All I ever wanted is to fight for a Lord I believed in. The good lords are dead and the rest are monsters.,1,5,43
8069,brienne, f,brienne, (Turns around). Better off with the Boltons who murdered her mother and brother? Sansa's in danger even if she doesn't realize it.,5,5,22
8070,brienne, f,brienne, Thank you. You've lived here a long time?,5,5,8
8071,brienne, f,brienne, Did you know Lord Eddard?,5,5,5
8072,brienne, f,brienne, Not all of them. I know who's inside that castle.,5,5,10
8073,brienne, f,brienne, I'm not talking about the Boltons. I need to get a message to her. To Sansa Stark.,5,5,17

8075,brienne, f,brienne, Her mother.,5,5,2
8076,brienne, f,brienne, That doesn't release me from an oath. I served Lady Catelyn. I serve her still. Who do you serve?,5,5,19

8091,brienne, f,brienne," Steal from the Tullys, it's their dungeons you rot in.",10,2,10
8092,brienne, f,brienne, I don't give the orders. He must be important to someone.,10,2,11
8093,brienne, f,brienne, I hope you gave them quick deaths.,10,2,7
8094,brienne, f,brienne," If this is the Kingslayer, I think I'd know about it.",10,2,11
8095,brienne, f,brienne," He's not the Kingslayer. Sorry to disappoint you. If he was, I'd only be traveling his head.",10,2,17

8114,brienne, f,brienne, I only held him that once as he was dying.,5,2,10
8115,brienne, f,brienne," I do not know your son, my lady. But I could serve you, if you would have me. You have courage. Not battle courage, perhaps, but, I don't know, a woman's kind of courage. And I think that when the time comes, you will not hold me back. Promise me that you will not hold me back from Stannis.",5,2,59
8116,brienne, f,brienne," Then I am yours, my lady. I will shield your back and give my life for yours, if it comes to that. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.",5,2,32

8120,brienne, f,brienne," Your son returns at dawn, my lady?",7,2,7
8121,brienne, f,brienne," The Kingslayer won't last the night. The more they drink, the angrier they'll get. And when the Karstarks draw their swords Who wants to die defending a Lannister?",7,2,28
8122,brienne, f,brienne, Nope.,1,7,1
8123,brienne, f,brienne, Nope.,1,7,1

8149,brienne, f,brienne," But I know Ser Jaime. He is a man of honor. I was his captor once. But when we were both taken prisoner and the men holding us tried to force themselves on me, Ser Jaime defended me. And lost his hand because of it.",2,8,45
8150,brienne, f,brienne," Without him, my lady, you would not be alive. He armed me, armored me, and sent me to find you and bring you home because he'd sworn an oath to your mother.",2,8,32
8151,brienne, f,brienne, I do.,2,8,2
8152,brienne, f,brienne, I would.,2,8,2

8189,brienne, f,brienne," Oh, move aside.",4,8,3
8190,brienne, f,brienne,  What are you doing?,4,8,4
8191,brienne, f,brienne, I've never slept with anyone before.,4,8,6
8192,brienne, f,brienne, I told you--,4,8,3
8193,brienne, f,brienne," Euron Greyjoy ambushed Queen Daenerys and her fleet. One of the dragons was killed, several ships destroyed, Missandei captured.",4,8,19
8194,brienne, f,brienne, They're going to destroy that city. You know they will.,4,8,10
8195,brienne, f,brienne, You're not like your sister. You're not. You're better than she is. You're a good man and you can't save her. You don't need to die with her. Stay here. Stay with me. (voice breaking) Please. Stay.,4,8,37
8196,brienne, f,brienne, Aye.,6,8,1
8197,brienne, f,brienne, Ser Podrick.,6,8,2
8198,brienne, f,brienne, Long may he reign.,6,8,4
8199,brienne, f,brienne, I think we can all agree that ships take precedence over brothels.,6,8,12
8200,brienne, f,brienne," You have a keen military mind, Pod.",8,6,7
8201,brienne, f,brienne, My name is Brienne of Tarth. Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister I’ve come to speak with him. Tell him I have his sword.,8,6,23
8202,brienne, f,brienne, Why would you assume that?,8,6,5
8203,brienne, f,brienne, I don’t think you know many girls like her.,8,6,9
8204,brienne, f,brienne, I’ve come for the Blackfish.,8,6,5
8205,brienne, f,brienne, Lady Sansa desires to take her ancestral seat back from the Boltons and assume her rightful position as Lady of Winterfell.,8,6,21
8206,brienne, f,brienne, The Tully army.,8,6,3
8207,brienne, f,brienne, The Tullys are rebels because they’re fighting for their home?,8,6,10
8208,brienne, f,brienne, As a reward for betraying Robb Stark and slaughtering his family.,8,6,11
8209,brienne, f,brienne," You’re a knight, Ser Jaime. I know there is honor in you. I’ve seen it myself.",8,6,16
8210,brienne, f,brienne, I do no such thing. Take Riverrun without bloodshed. Ride south with your mission complete and your army intact.,8,6,19
8211,brienne, f,brienne, Allow me to enter Riverrun under a flag of truce. Let me try to persuade the Blackfish to give up the castle.,8,6,22
8212,brienne, f,brienne, Because you’ll allow him to lead the Tully forces safely north.,8,6,11
8213,brienne, f,brienne, No.,8,6,1
8214,brienne, f,brienne," I need your word. If I persuade him to abandon the castle, you’ll grant us safe passage north.",8,6,18
8215,brienne, f,brienne, You gave it to me for a purpose. I’ve achieved that purpose.,8,6,12
8216,brienne, f,brienne," one last thing, Ser Jaime.",8,6,5
8217,brienne, f,brienne," Should I fail to persuade the Blackfish to surrender, and if you attack the castle, honor compels me to fight for Sansa’s kin.",8,6,23
8218,brienne, f,brienne, To fight you.,8,6,3
8219,brienne, f,brienne, I have a signed letter from your niece Sansa Stark.,8,6,10
8220,brienne, f,brienne, He always spoke highly of you.,8,6,6
8221,brienne, f,brienne, Riverrun cannot stand against the Lannisters and the Freys.,8,6,9
8222,brienne, f,brienne, He’s not my friend.,8,6,4
8223,brienne, f,brienne," Ser Jaime kept his word to your niece Catelyn Stark. He sent me to find Sansa, to help her as Catelyn wanted. He gave me this sword to protect her. That is what I have done and I will continue to do until the day I die.",8,6,47
8224,brienne, f,brienne, You have more than she does.,8,6,6
8225,brienne, f,brienne, Find the maester. We need to get a raven north to Sansa.,8,6,12
8226,brienne, f,brienne, Tell her I failed.,8,6,4
8227,brienne, f,brienne, Come with us.,8,6,3
8228,brienne, f,brienne, Your family is in the North. Come with us. Don’t die for pride when you can fight for your blood.,8,6,20
8229,brienne, f,brienne," I saw her with a man. I don’t think he hurt her. She didn’t want to leave him, he didn’t want to leave her.",2,6,24
8230,brienne, f,brienne, I spent three days looking for her. She disappeared.,2,6,9
8231,brienne, f,brienne, She looked good. She wasn’t exactly dressed like a lady.,2,6,10
8232,brienne, f,brienne, What happened at Winterfell?,2,6,4
8233,brienne, f,brienne," It was a difficult choice, my lady.",2,6,7
8234,brienne, f,brienne, We’ve all had to make difficult choices.,2,6,7
8235,brienne, f,brienne," Lady Sansa, I offer my services once again. I will shield your back and keep your council and give my life for yours if need be. I swear it by the old gods and the new.",1,6,36
8236,brienne, f,brienne, Lady Sansa asked you a question.,5,6,6
8237,brienne, f,brienne," I’ve sworn to protect you, my lady.",5,6,7
8238,brienne, f,brienne, We can send the Blackfish a raven.,5,6,7
8239,brienne, f,brienne, I don’t like leaving you here alone.,5,6,7
8240,brienne, f,brienne," Not him. He seems trustworthy. A bit brooding, perhaps. I suppose that’s understandable, considering. The others, though. Davos and the Red Woman helped a man murder his own brother with blood magic. And when Stannis paid for his crime, where were they? Already out looking for a leader with better prospects. And that wildling fellow with the beard --",5,6,59
8241,brienne, f,brienne, Then why did you lie to him when he asked you how you learned about Riverrun?,5,6,16
8242,brienne, f,brienne,  I saw what happened. I saw Stannis’ forces defeated in the field.,4,6,12
8243,brienne, f,brienne, We’ve met before. I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon. Before Renly was assassinated with bloodmagic.,4,6,15
8244,brienne, f,brienne," Yes, it’s in the past. It doesn’t mean I forget. Or forgive. He admitted it, you know.",4,6,17
8245,brienne, f,brienne, Stannis. Just before I executed him.,4,6,6
8246,pycell, m,pycell," In the sight of gods and men, we gather to ascertain the guilt or innocence of this...man Tyrion Lannister. May the Mother grant them mercy. May the Father give them such justice as they deserve. And may the Warrior guide the hand of our champion...",8,4,45
8247,tyrion, m,tyrion, Lady Sansa.,8,3,2
8248,tyrion, m,tyrion," Oh, yes. The husband of your dreams. But you do look glorious. Perhaps we could have a moment alone. Do you mind? Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark's handmaiden?",8,3,29
8249,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  My lady, I want you to know I didn't ask for this.",8,3,12
8250,tyrion, m,tyrion, You're right. I have no idea how you feel. And you have no idea how I feel.,8,3,17
8251,tyrion, m,tyrion," But I promise you one thing, my lady. I won't ever hurt you. Do you drink wine?",8,3,17
8252,tyrion, m,tyrion," Well, today you have to.",8,3,5
8253,tyrion, m,tyrion, Could you-,8,3,2
8254,tyrion, m,tyrion, Thank you.,8,3,2
8255,tyrion, m,tyrion, (snorts),8,3,1
8256,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Of course. Of course. En--enjoy.,8,3,5
8257,tyrion, m,tyrion, Rather less than I plan to be. Isn't it a man's duty to be drunk at his own wedding?,8,3,19
8258,tyrion, m,tyrion, And?,8,3,1
8259,tyrion, m,tyrion, What did you once call me?  A drunken little lust-filled beast.,8,3,11
8260,tyrion, m,tyrion," There you have it. Nothing to worry about. Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things. I am the god of tits and wine. I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit.",8,3,40
8261,tyrion, m,tyrion, There will be no bedding ceremony.,8,3,6
8262,tyrion, m,tyrion, There will be no bedding ceremony.,8,3,6
8263,tyrion, m,tyrion, Then you'll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock.,8,3,11
8264,tyrion, m,tyrion," A bad joke, Your Grace. Made out of envy of your own royal manhood. Mine is so small. My poor wife won't even know I'm there.",8,3,26
8265,tyrion, m,tyrion," My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do. Come, wife.",8,3,13
8266,tyrion, m,tyrion," I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act. Not proud of it. But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, don't you agree?  Come, I'll tell you all about it. Put you in the mood.",8,3,42
8267,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Tyrion, Sansa. My name is Tyrion.",8,3,6
8268,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Nothing was ever wiser.,8,3,4
8269,tyrion, m,tyrion, Astoundingly long.,8,3,2
8270,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Neck. You have one. How old are you exactly?,8,3,9
8271,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Well, talk won't make you any older. My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage.",8,3,17
8272,tyrion, m,tyrion," Stop. I can't. I could, I won't.",8,3,7
8273,tyrion, m,tyrion," If my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start. I won't share your bed. Not until you want me to.",8,3,25
8274,tyrion, m,tyrion,  And so my watch begins.,8,3,5
8275,tyrion, m,tyrion, You really ought to knock.,8,3,5
8276,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Hmm. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.,10,3,15
8277,tyrion, m,tyrion, I have a list.,10,3,4
8278,tyrion, m,tyrion," For laughing at me? Do I look like Joffrey to you? No, death seems a bit extreme. Fear of death, on the other hand--",10,3,24
8279,tyrion, m,tyrion," My lady, people have been laughing at me far longer than they've been laughing at you. I'm the Halfman, the Demon Monkey, the Imp.",10,3,24
8280,tyrion, m,tyrion, The disgraced daughter and the Demon Monkey. We're perfect for each other.,10,3,12
8281,tyrion, m,tyrion, Who? Whom?,10,3,2
8282,tyrion, m,tyrion, Ah. I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions. Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert.,10,3,19
8283,tyrion, m,tyrion, I am the Imp. I have certain standards to maintain.,10,3,10
8284,tyrion, m,tyrion, Lady Sansa!,10,3,2
8285,tyrion, m,tyrion, Why sheep shift?,10,3,3
8286,tyrion, m,tyrion, My lady--,10,3,2
8287,tyrion, m,tyrion, Killed a few puppies today?,10,3,5
8288,tyrion, m,tyrion, 'Roslin caught a fine fat trout. Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding. Signed Walder Frey.' Is that bad poetry or is it supposed to mean something?,10,3,32
8289,tyrion, m,tyrion, No. She is no longer yours to torment.,10,3,8
8290,tyrion, m,tyrion," Oh, I'm a monster. Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies.",10,3,24
8291,tyrion, m,tyrion, You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper.,10,3,14
8292,tyrion, m,tyrion, A treasonous statement. Joffrey is king.,10,3,6
8293,tyrion, m,tyrion, No. I think armies give you power.,10,3,7
8294,tyrion, m,tyrion," Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him all the same.",10,3,15
8295,tyrion, m,tyrion," Oh, I know. Walder Frey gets all the credit. Or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance. Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man? No. He never would have risked such an action if he didn't have certain assurances.",10,3,42
8296,tyrion, m,tyrion, I'm all for cheating. This is war.,10,3,7
8297,tyrion, m,tyrion, So that's why you did it? To save lives?,10,3,9
8298,tyrion, m,tyrion, The northerners will never forget.,10,3,5
8299,tyrion, m,tyrion, Do you think she'll open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother?,10,3,20
8300,tyrion, m,tyrion, I will not rape her.,10,3,5
8301,tyrion, m,tyrion, Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.,10,3,9
8302,tyrion, m,tyrion, (smirks),10,3,1
8303,tyrion, m,tyrion," No, it's a very good lesson. Only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you're making all the decisions.",10,3,23
8304,tyrion, m,tyrion, When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family?,10,3,19
8305,tyrion, m,tyrion, Sansa.,10,3,1
8306,tyrion, m,tyrion, Keep up.,10,3,2
8307,tyrion, m,tyrion, It's not easy being drunk all the time. Everyone would do it if it were easy.,10,3,16
8308,tyrion, m,tyrion, She doesn't deserve this.,10,3,4
8309,tyrion, m,tyrion, There's nothing worse than a late-blooming philosopher.,10,3,7
8310,tyrion, m,tyrion, Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras with the same philosophical spirit?,10,3,14
8311,tyrion, m,tyrion, I seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage.,10,3,11
8312,tyrion, m,tyrion, So you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it?,10,3,14
8313,tyrion, m,tyrion, You have children. How happy would you say you are?,10,3,10
8314,tyrion, m,tyrion, Even Joffrey?,10,3,2
8315,tyrion, m,tyrion, How long does it go on?,10,3,6
8316,tyrion, m,tyrion," Every time we deal with an enemy, we create two more.",10,3,11
8317,tyrion, m,tyrion, Intimate. Lovely table. Better chairs than the old small council chamber. Conveniently close to your own quarters. I like it.,3,3,20
8318,tyrion, m,tyrion," Far be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelish's absence would present certain problems. The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory. Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead. Not a good time to leave the crown's finances unattended.",3,3,48
8319,tyrion, m,tyrion, Master of Coin?,3,3,3
8320,tyrion, m,tyrion," I'm quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasn't taught me much about managing it.",3,3,19
8321,tyrion, m,tyrion, A surprising place to keep the royal ledgers.,3,3,8
8322,tyrion, m,tyrion, Not for bastards.,3,3,3
8323,tyrion, m,tyrion, Pod. Pod. Take them outside. I'll be there in a moment.,3,3,11
8324,tyrion, m,tyrion," Only my life. Not all that significant, I'm afraid.",3,3,9
8325,tyrion, m,tyrion, If only the Master of Coin had such power.,3,3,9
8326,tyrion, m,tyrion," Oh, that. Of course. A simple misunderstanding.",3,3,7
8327,tyrion, m,tyrion, We don't. I did fuck her once.,3,3,7
8328,tyrion, m,tyrion,  But we don't.,3,3,3
8329,tyrion, m,tyrion, Why don't you ask her? Any advice for me on my new position?,3,3,13
8330,tyrion, m,tyrion," If I had a gold dragon for every time I heard that joke, I'd be richer than you are.",3,3,19
8331,tyrion, m,tyrion, Good point.,3,3,2
8332,tyrion, m,tyrion," I've tried quite a few. Well, lots of work to do. Enjoy the Eyrie.",3,3,14
8333,tyrion, m,tyrion, You think all reading is dull reading.,3,3,7
8334,tyrion, m,tyrion, The secret history of the Seven Kingdoms is written in these pages.,3,3,12
8335,tyrion, m,tyrion," Unless he made it all up, yes.  Podrick, do keep up.",3,3,11
8336,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Podrick.,3,3,1
8337,tyrion, m,tyrion," After a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn, I finally found a suitable reward for the services you've provided over and above what might be considered reasonable. Tell me, Pod, have you ever been with a woman?",3,3,38
8338,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Wonderful. Genna specializes in first-timers.,3,3,5
8339,tyrion, m,tyrion," A fair enough repayment for putting your spear through my would-be killer's face, wouldn't you say?",3,3,16
8340,tyrion, m,tyrion," Now, as it happens, Marei is quite the spear handler herself. She's here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me.",3,3,28
8341,tyrion, m,tyrion, Kayla is famous from here to Volantis in certain circles. One of four women in the world who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot.,3,3,24
8342,tyrion, m,tyrion,  She's here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow who's never once failed to address me as 'my lord.,3,3,21
8343,tyrion, m,tyrion, Be back in time for my supper.,3,3,7
8344,tyrion, m,tyrion," For years I've heard that Littlefinger is a magician. Whenever the crown needs money, he rubs his hands together and, poof, mountains of gold.",3,3,24
8345,tyrion, m,tyrion, No.,3,3,1
8346,tyrion, m,tyrion," Worse, he's borrowing it.",3,3,4
8347,tyrion, m,tyrion," We can't afford to pay it back, that's what's wrong with it. The crown owes millions to my father.",3,3,19
8348,tyrion, m,tyrion," Forgive a debt, my father? For a man of the world, you're strangely naive.",3,3,14
8349,tyrion, m,tyrion," Well Ahem! The basic principle is I lend you money, and after an agreed upon period of time, you return it with interest.",3,3,23
8350,tyrion, m,tyrion," Well, you have to.",3,3,4
8351,tyrion, m,tyrion," This is why I don't lend you money. Anyway, it's not my father I'm worried about. It's the Iron Bank of Braavos. We owe them tens of millions. If we fail to repay these loans, the bank will fund our enemies. One way or another, they always get their gold back.",3,3,51
8352,tyrion, m,tyrion," Ah, the return of the conquering hero. Does he have a little jaunt in his step?",3,3,16
8353,tyrion, m,tyrion, You were gone a long time. I trust you got your money's worth. Or should I say my money's worth?,3,3,20
8354,tyrion, m,tyrion," Oh, it was a gift, Podrick. This is more than I give you in a year.",3,3,16
8355,tyrion, m,tyrion," Oh, then it's much more than I give you in a year.",3,3,12
8356,tyrion, m,tyrion, Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold? They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them.,3,3,23
8357,tyrion, m,tyrion,  What did you do to them?,3,3,6
8358,tyrion, m,tyrion, And they seemed to like these things?,3,3,7
8359,tyrion, m,tyrion, Only they weren't paid.,3,3,4
8360,tyrion, m,tyrion, Is that what you're telling us?  {PODRICK doesn't deny it.,3,3,10
8361,tyrion, m,tyrion," Sit down, Podrick.",3,3,3
8362,tyrion, m,tyrion, We're going to need details. Copious details.,3,3,7
8363,tyrion, m,tyrion, We've spoken of this. You cannot come here.,2,3,8
8364,tyrion, m,tyrion, Did anyone see you? No.,2,3,5
8365,tyrion, m,tyrion, You sure? My father does not make idle threats. Having you killed would be the high point of his week. You have to be absolutely certain.,2,3,26
8366,tyrion, m,tyrion, All right. What is this problem?,2,3,6
8367,tyrion, m,tyrion, Baelish doesn't have friends.,2,3,4
8368,tyrion, m,tyrion," Oh, Ros? The redhead?",2,3,4
8369,tyrion, m,tyrion, I try to know as many people as I can. You never know which one you'll need.,2,3,17
8370,tyrion, m,tyrion," Yes, well, we shouldn't be judgmental about these things.",2,3,9
8371,tyrion, m,tyrion," Oh, please. All right, yes, I fucked her once. Twice.",2,3,10
8372,tyrion, m,tyrion," But since I met you, my lady, I've been with no one else.",2,3,13
8373,tyrion, m,tyrion," Not as much as I like you, obviously, or she'd be the one torturing me right now. What did she say about Littlefinger?",2,3,23
8374,tyrion, m,tyrion, Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?,2,3,10
8375,tyrion, m,tyrion," We can't. Now that the Lannisters have discarded her, Sansa will have many suitors. A great beauty with a very old name.",2,3,22
8376,tyrion, m,tyrion," Yes, she is, objectively, very. Her face is quite pleasing-to other men and to women, people in general. But not to me, of course. I only have eyes for you.",2,3,30
8377,tyrion, m,tyrion,  I don't even want to talk about her.,2,3,8
8378,tyrion, m,tyrion, Only because you're making me.,2,3,5
8379,tyrion, m,tyrion, This is cruel and unfair. Cruelly unfair.,2,3,7
8380,tyrion, m,tyrion," Hmm, yes.",2,3,2
8381,tyrion, m,tyrion, Only if you stop. But you mustn't come here again.,2,3,10
8382,tyrion, m,tyrion, Do you hear me? You've come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people. Dangerous people.,2,3,16
8383,tyrion, m,tyrion, Pod?,1,3,1
8384,tyrion, m,tyrion, What are they doing here?,1,3,5
8385,tyrion, m,tyrion," No, I don't think so.",1,3,5
8386,tyrion, m,tyrion, They stay outside.,1,3,3
8387,tyrion, m,tyrion, Why are you here?,1,3,4
8388,tyrion, m,tyrion, The man who cut me lost more than his nose.,1,3,10
8389,tyrion, m,tyrion," Thanks to Father. Of course, it wasn't a rebel who tried to kill me.",1,3,14
8390,tyrion, m,tyrion, Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke. You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees.,1,3,23
8391,tyrion, m,tyrion, How do you know that?,1,3,5
8392,tyrion, m,tyrion," What do I want from him? He's my father. Do I need to want something? I'm sure he loves me dearly, as any father loves his child, his baby boy. Yet he hasn't come to visit once since arriving in King's Landing. I lay here, my face split in half, but Father never came.",1,3,54
8393,tyrion, m,tyrion, Why do you care what I want from him?,1,3,9
8394,tyrion, m,tyrion, Slandered? When?,1,3,2
8395,tyrion, m,tyrion," You did have your guards beat her. A girl of nine, I believe.",1,3,13
8396,tyrion, m,tyrion," She lost an eye, if I remember correctly.",1,3,8
8397,tyrion, m,tyrion, It's not slander if it's true.,1,3,6
8398,tyrion, m,tyrion, Why are you so nervous about what I'm going to say to Father?,1,3,13
8399,tyrion, m,tyrion, Any lies in particular?,1,3,4
8400,tyrion, m,tyrion, Still makes me more clever than you.,1,3,7
8401,tyrion, m,tyrion, A number of people in this city want to kill me. You're here to protect me.,1,3,16
8402,tyrion, m,tyrion, Do you grow bored protecting me?,1,3,6
8403,tyrion, m,tyrion," Poor? Poor? Under my patronage you've become a knight, you've served as Commander of the City Watch.",1,3,17
8404,tyrion, m,tyrion, I'm sure you filled your pockets.,1,3,6
8405,tyrion, m,tyrion, I thought we were friends.,1,3,5
8406,tyrion, m,tyrion, How much?,1,3,2
8407,tyrion, m,tyrion, Double?,1,3,1
8408,tyrion, m,tyrion, I don't even know how much I'm paying you now.,1,3,10
8409,tyrion, m,tyrion, ( sighs ) The badge looks good on you. Almost as good as it looked on me. Are you enjoying your new position?,1,3,23
8410,tyrion, m,tyrion, I was very happy as Hand of the King.,1,3,9
8411,tyrion, m,tyrion, It wasn't your bed at the time.,1,3,7
8412,tyrion, m,tyrion, Occasionally I drank with the harlots.,1,3,6
8413,tyrion, m,tyrion, Why does everyone assume I want something? Can't I simply visit with my beloved father? My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield.,1,3,32
8414,tyrion, m,tyrion," I organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal. I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls. I bled in the mud for our family. And as my reward, I was trundled off to some dark little cell. But what do I want? A little bloody gratitude would be a start.",1,3,72
8415,tyrion, m,tyrion," I want what is mine by right. Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles. But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance. The day Jaime put on the white cloak, he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock. I am your son and lawful heir.",1,3,51
8416,tyrion, m,tyrion, It is mine by right.,1,3,5
8417,tyrion, m,tyrion, Why?,1,3,1
8418,tyrion, m,tyrion," Thank you for seeing me, my lady. I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters.",5,3,17
8419,tyrion, m,tyrion, It's the royal wedding. I'm told you had a hand in planning it.,5,3,13
8420,tyrion, m,tyrion, It's shaping up to be a very involved affair. The word extravagant has been used.,5,3,15
8421,tyrion, m,tyrion, I understand that.,5,3,3
8422,tyrion, m,tyrion," But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown. As of now, it's a huge expense.",5,3,23
8423,tyrion, m,tyrion," And we're at war, Lady Olenna.",5,3,6
8424,tyrion, m,tyrion," Yes, and maintaining supply lines--",5,3,5
8425,tyrion, m,tyrion, And we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm.,5,3,17
8426,tyrion, m,tyrion, I would.,5,3,2
8427,tyrion, m,tyrion, (nods),5,3,1
8428,tyrion, m,tyrion, My lady--,5,3,2
8429,tyrion, m,tyrion, Quite sufficient. Thank you.,5,3,4
8430,tyrion, m,tyrion, Give me that.,5,3,3
8431,tyrion, m,tyrion, What's she doing here?,5,3,4
8432,tyrion, m,tyrion," You'll be pleased to learn that after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell, I've saved the crown hundreds of thousands on this wedding.",5,3,22
8433,tyrion, m,tyrion, I'm Master of Coin. Saving money is important.,5,3,8
8434,tyrion, m,tyrion, (to Cersei) Stop that. You're making me uncomfortable.,5,3,8
8435,tyrion, m,tyrion," Very well. She's a lovely girl. Missing some of Loras' favorite bits, but I'm sure they'll make do.",5,3,18
8436,tyrion, m,tyrion," It wasn't my best, but--",5,3,5
8437,tyrion, m,tyrion, Sansa is the key to the North? I seem to remember she has an older brother.,5,3,16
8438,tyrion, m,tyrion, The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war. Do you really think it's wise to refuse them?,5,3,19
8439,tyrion, m,tyrion, And how do we do that?,5,3,6
8440,tyrion, m,tyrion, Wonderful.,5,3,1
8441,tyrion, m,tyrion, You can't mean it.,5,3,4
8442,tyrion, m,tyrion, Joffrey has made this poor girl's life miserable since the day he took her father's head. Now she's finally free of him and you give her to me? That's cruel even for you.,5,3,33
8443,tyrion, m,tyrion, She's a child!,5,3,3
8444,tyrion, m,tyrion, And if I refuse?,5,3,4
8445,tyrion, m,tyrion, I was wed. Or don't you remember?,5,3,7
8446,tyrion, m,tyrion, I hope we might speak. In confidence.,4,3,7
8447,tyrion, m,tyrion, About the events of the Blackwater. Perhaps this is the wrong time?,4,3,12
8448,tyrion, m,tyrion, I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sister's intentions to--,4,3,15
8449,tyrion, m,tyrion," I didn't inherit Littlefinger's spies along with his position, I'm afraid. Which is why I'm coming to you. I need proof.",4,3,21
8450,tyrion, m,tyrion, I need to know.,4,3,4
8451,tyrion, m,tyrion, I don't know. Do I?,4,3,5
8452,tyrion, m,tyrion," Yes, ahem. I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed. Which will require a degree of influence, which--",4,3,27
8453,tyrion, m,tyrion, The sorcerer.,4,3,2
8454,tyrion, m,tyrion, I don't suppose there's anything we can do about this.,6,3,10
8455,tyrion, m,tyrion, It's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement. Probably Sansa. Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery.,6,3,31
8456,tyrion, m,tyrion, On a boat you built.,6,3,5
8457,tyrion, m,tyrion, I'm your family. A member of your family who has actively contributed to that family's survival. Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it.,6,3,29
8458,tyrion, m,tyrion, Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you. There are two people in King's Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard. Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?,6,3,46
8459,tyrion, m,tyrion," The impulse I understand. He hates me because I'm the only one who tells him what he really is. So, fair enough. He wants me dead. But his stupidity? He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known. But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army. The boy's an idiot.",6,3,65
8460,tyrion, m,tyrion, I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger.,6,3,13
8461,tyrion, m,tyrion, Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister.,6,3,8
8462,tyrion, m,tyrion," You may escape, at least. Once Jaime gets back, Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels.",6,3,22
8463,tyrion, m,tyrion," Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked.",6,3,6
8464,tyrion, m,tyrion," I beg your pardon, my lady.",6,3,6
8465,tyrion, m,tyrion," Yes, it should be quite a wedding. I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa.",6,3,15
8466,tyrion, m,tyrion," Alone, if I may.",6,3,4
8467,tyrion, m,tyrion, Sometimes we think we want to hear something and it's only afterwards when it's too late that we realize we wished we'd heard it under entirely different circumstances.,6,3,28
8468,tyrion, m,tyrion, She's a child.,7,3,3
8469,tyrion, m,tyrion, A tall child.,7,3,3
8470,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Not that young.,7,3,3
8471,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Older.,7,3,1
8472,tyrion, m,tyrion, Shae isn't going to like it.,7,3,6
8473,tyrion, m,tyrion,  I should never have told you about that.,7,3,8
8474,tyrion, m,tyrion, Two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them.,7,3,12
8475,tyrion, m,tyrion, I don't pay you to put evil notions in my head. The ones already there don't need company.,7,3,18
8476,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Solid gold from the mines outside Lannisport. Smithed in Casterly Rock.,7,3,11
8477,tyrion, m,tyrion, You could buy a ship with these.,7,3,7
8478,tyrion, m,tyrion, What?,7,3,1
8479,tyrion, m,tyrion, Of course you're not going anywhere.,7,3,6
8480,tyrion, m,tyrion,  I didn't ask for this marriage. I didn't want it.,7,3,10
8481,tyrion, m,tyrion," That doesn't mean that--this is duty, not desire.",7,3,8
8482,tyrion, m,tyrion,  I don't have a choice. My father--,7,3,7
8483,tyrion, m,tyrion, What would I do there? Juggle? I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock.,7,3,13
8484,tyrion, m,tyrion, My feelings for you have not changed. I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her.,7,3,18
8485,tyrion, m,tyrion,  I swear to you it will not be like that.,7,3,10
8486,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  I will buy you a good home somewhere in the city. You will have fine clothes, guards to keep you safe, servants. Any children we might have will be well provided for.",7,3,32
8487,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Listen. Listen to me, my lady.",7,3,6
8488,tyrion, m,tyrion, You are. You'll always be my lady.,7,3,7
8489,tyrion, m,tyrion, Wine always helps. I thank you for it. Trial by combat. Deciding a man's guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces. Tells you something about the gods. How much longer?,8,4,42
8490,tyrion, m,tyrion," Do you think Oberyn has a chance? The Red Viper of Dorne. You don't get a name like that unless you're deadly, right?",8,4,23
8491,tyrion, m,tyrion," Oh, he's going to die. I'm going to die.",8,4,9
8492,tyrion, m,tyrion, That's putting it mildly. What's the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel?,8,4,17
8493,tyrion, m,tyrion," Seems rather ordinary. And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons. Nepoticide. That's the one. Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide. There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word.",8,4,39
8494,tyrion, m,tyrion," Cousins, you're right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?",8,4,19
8495,tyrion, m,tyrion, Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock.,8,4,14
8496,tyrion, m,tyrion, Nothing made him happier.,8,4,4
8497,tyrion, m,tyrion, On the contrary. Laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.,8,4,19
8498,tyrion, m,tyrion, For you. You drifted away.,8,4,5
8499,tyrion, m,tyrion," Yes, other interests. But I stayed with Orson.",8,4,8
8500,tyrion, m,tyrion," I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him. ""Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?"" He gave me an answer. ""Smash the beetles. Smash 'em. Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!"" I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik's library.",8,4,79
8501,tyrion, m,tyrion," Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons. Doesn't seem right. In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. *picks up a beetle* And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand. But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of ""khuu, khuu, khuu"". And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard ""khuu, khuu, khuu"" and I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it. And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason.",8,4,233
8502,tyrion, m,tyrion," I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see. I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies. I tried to stop Orson once.",8,4,74
8503,tyrion, m,tyrion," He just pushed me aside with a ""khuu"" and kept on smashing. Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him. *puts the beetle back on the ground* So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about?",8,4,47
8504,tyrion, m,tyrion, Looks like very light armor.,8,4,5
8505,tyrion, m,tyrion, You could at least wear a helmet. You shouldn't drink before a fight.,8,4,13
8506,tyrion, m,tyrion, It could get you killed. It could get me killed.,8,4,10
8507,tyrion, m,tyrion, Thank the gods.,8,4,3
8508,tyrion, m,tyrion," Oh, get on with it you son of a whore.",10,4,10
8509,tyrion, m,tyrion, What’re you doing?,10,4,3
8510,tyrion, m,tyrion, Who’s helping you?,10,4,3
8511,tyrion, m,tyrion, Varys?,10,4,1
8512,tyrion, m,tyrion," I suppose this is goodbye, then.",10,4,6
8513,tyrion, m,tyrion," Jaime, thank you. For my life.",10,4,6
8514,tyrion, m,tyrion, I’m sorry. I’m sorry.,10,4,4
8515,tyrion, m,tyrion," All my life, you’ve wanted me dead.",10,4,7
8516,tyrion, m,tyrion, I loved her.,10,4,3
8517,tyrion, m,tyrion, Shae.,10,4,1
8518,tyrion, m,tyrion, I murdered her. With my own hands.,10,4,7
8519,tyrion, m,tyrion, It doesn’t matter?,10,4,3
8520,tyrion, m,tyrion, Say that word again.,10,4,4
8521,tyrion, m,tyrion," I am your son, and you sentenced me to die. You knew I didn’t poison Joffrey, but you sentenced me all the same. Why?",10,4,24
8522,tyrion, m,tyrion, I can’t go back there. She’s in there.,10,4,8
8523,tyrion, m,tyrion, I am your son. I have always been your son.,10,4,10
8524,tyrion, m,tyrion, Podrick. Apologies for the stench.,3,4,5
8525,tyrion, m,tyrion, A noble effort.,3,4,3
8526,tyrion, m,tyrion, You're a good lad. Any word of Shae?,3,4,8
8527,tyrion, m,tyrion, I suppose that's a good thing. What are they saying about me out there?,3,4,14
8528,tyrion, m,tyrion, Do you believe I murdered Joffrey?,3,4,6
8529,tyrion, m,tyrion," No. Gods, no. The world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it. I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination, I'd plan it in such a way that I wouldn't be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died. Trial in a fortnight. Have they announced the judges yet?",3,4,62
8530,tyrion, m,tyrion, Of course.,3,4,2
8531,tyrion, m,tyrion, Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote.,3,4,11
8532,tyrion, m,tyrion, Oberyn? Give it to my father. He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy.,3,4,16
8533,tyrion, m,tyrion," Oh, I can call my own witnesses? How generous of them. Very well, my wife. Sansa.",3,4,16
8534,tyrion, m,tyrion, Gone?,3,4,1
8535,tyrion, m,tyrion," No one had more 'cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa, but the girl is no assassin. Whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it. And with my wife's disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty. Podrick.",3,4,42
8536,tyrion, m,tyrion, They'll be following you now.,3,4,5
8537,tyrion, m,tyrion," I don't know. They. They. The ominous they. The man pulling the strings. Or woman. My father. Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him. Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle. Whenever something bad happens to me, I assume it's my sister that had a hand in it. But say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children. She is the only one I'm certain had nothing to do with this murder. Which makes it unique as King's Landing murders go.",3,4,85
8538,tyrion, m,tyrion, Varys could vouch for me if he dared.,3,4,8
8539,tyrion, m,tyrion, Of course. Fetch Bronn. I have a job for him.,3,4,10
8540,tyrion, m,tyrion, Why not?,3,4,2
8541,tyrion, m,tyrion, And my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?,3,4,12
8542,tyrion, m,tyrion, Ser Podrick Payne? Has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him?,3,4,14
8543,tyrion, m,tyrion, Are you going to accept their offer?,3,4,7
8544,tyrion, m,tyrion," Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion. If they can't tempt you with honey, they'll choose something less sweet.",3,4,18
8545,tyrion, m,tyrion," Pod, the trial's in a fortnight. They'll want an answer before that.",3,4,12
8546,tyrion, m,tyrion," I will not have you dying on my behalf. Do you hear me? If I have to take that long walk to the executioner's block, I don't want to see your head already mounted.",3,4,34
8547,tyrion, m,tyrion," Pod, I am giving you an order. Go and find my brother. Tell him I need him. And get yourself out of King's Landing before it's too late. Pod! This is farewell.",3,4,32
8548,tyrion, m,tyrion, Pod. There has never lived a more loyal squire.,3,4,9
8549,tyrion, m,tyrion," Your new hand, it's nicer than the old one. Wouldn't you agree, Pod?",2,4,13
8550,tyrion, m,tyrion, You're not eating. Why is no one eating? My wife wastes away and my brother starves himself.,2,4,17
8551,tyrion, m,tyrion," You lost a hand, not a stomach. Try the boar. Cersei can't get enough of it since one killed Robert for her.",2,4,22
8552,tyrion, m,tyrion," A toast. To the proud Lannister children. The dwarf, the cripple, and the mother of madness.",2,4,16
8553,tyrion, m,tyrion, It's only wine.,2,4,3
8554,tyrion, m,tyrion, What about your left?,2,4,4
8555,tyrion, m,tyrion, You're the Lord Commander now. Command. Let others do the fighting. When was the last time Father used a sword?,2,4,20
8556,tyrion, m,tyrion," Train, then. Learn to fight with your other hand.",2,4,9
8557,tyrion, m,tyrion," You need a proper, discreet swordsman. As it happens, I have just the one.",2,4,14
8558,tyrion, m,tyrion, Lord Varys. Breakfasting with the king?,2,4,6
8559,tyrion, m,tyrion," Oh, to be foreign.",2,4,4
8560,tyrion, m,tyrion, So I'm guilty of being seen with my own wife's handmaiden. My father will ask you if there's anything more and you'll tell him some clever lie.,2,4,27
8561,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Forgive me if I don't weep for you.,2,4,8
8562,tyrion, m,tyrion," She won't leave. I've told her this is a dangerous place so many times, she no longer believes it.",2,4,19
8563,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  ""The Lives of Four Kings."" Grand Maester Kaeth's history of the reigns of Daeron the Young Dragon, Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the Unworthy, and Daeron the Good. A book every king should read.",2,4,33
8564,tyrion, m,tyrion, Don't.,2,4,1
8565,tyrion, m,tyrion, Don't call me that.,2,4,4
8566,tyrion, m,tyrion, I'm afraid our friendship can't continue.,2,4,6
8567,tyrion, m,tyrion, There's a ship waiting in the harbor bound for Pentos.,2,4,10
8568,tyrion, m,tyrion," I'm a married man. My wife has suffered a great deal, as you well know. I don't want her to suffer anymore on my account. I need to uphold my vows.",2,4,31
8569,tyrion, m,tyrion,  I need to do right by her.,2,4,7
8570,tyrion, m,tyrion,  By our children.,2,4,3
8571,tyrion, m,tyrion,  I'm not afraid.,2,4,3
8572,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Shae.,2,4,1
8573,tyrion, m,tyrion," You're a whore! Sansa is fit to bear my children and you are not. I can't be in love with a whore. I can't have children with a whore. How many men have you been with? 500? 5,000?",2,4,38
8574,tyrion, m,tyrion, I have enjoyed my time with all of them and I have enjoyed my time with you most of all. But now that time is over.,2,4,26
8575,tyrion, m,tyrion, You'll have a comfortable life in Pentos. Bronn will escort you to your ship.,2,4,14
8576,tyrion, m,tyrion, Better her than you.,2,4,4
8577,tyrion, m,tyrion, You saw her board the ship?,2,4,6
8578,tyrion, m,tyrion, You saw the ship sail away?,2,4,6
8579,tyrion, m,tyrion, How do you know?,2,4,4
8580,tyrion, m,tyrion, There's someone following you?,2,4,4
8581,tyrion, m,tyrion, Hello.,2,4,1
8582,tyrion, m,tyrion, My lady. My lady.,2,4,4
8583,tyrion, m,tyrion, We'll have to find another way to thank the king.,2,4,10
8584,tyrion, m,tyrion," One taste of combat was enough for me, Your Grace. I would like to keep what remains of my face. I think you should fight him. This was but a poor imitation of your own bravery on the field of battle. I speak as a firsthand witness. Climb down from the high table with your new Valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne. Be careful, though. This one is clearly mad with lust. It would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night.",2,4,95
8585,tyrion, m,tyrion, A fine vintage. Shame that it spilled.,2,4,7
8586,tyrion, m,tyrion, Your Grace does me a great honor.,2,4,7
8587,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Let's find out.,2,4,3
8588,tyrion, m,tyrion," I thought I might change out of these wet clothes, Your Grace.",2,4,12
8589,tyrion, m,tyrion," If it please Your Grace, Lady Sansa is very tired.",2,4,10
8590,tyrion, m,tyrion, Your Grace?,2,4,2
8591,tyrion, m,tyrion, Please don't.,1,4,2
8592,tyrion, m,tyrion," This is the Prince of Dorne we're waiting for, not one of your sellsword friends.",1,4,15
8593,tyrion, m,tyrion, There's bad blood between the Martells of Dorne and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. Has been for years.,1,4,18
8594,tyrion, m,tyrion, No need for cynicism. I happen to be an accomplished diplomat.,1,4,11
8595,tyrion, m,tyrion," Ah, here we are.",1,4,4
8596,tyrion, m,tyrion, Can you read the sigils?,1,4,5
8597,tyrion, m,tyrion, Boy knows his Dornish Houses.,1,4,5
8598,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  And House Martell, a red sun pierced by a spear?",1,4,10
8599,tyrion, m,tyrion," Well met, my lords. His Grace King Joffrey welcomes you in his name. My lord father, the King's Hand, sends his greetings as well. I am Tyrion Lannister of Casterly Rock, Master of Coin. Forgive me. I don't see Prince Doran in your company.",1,4,44
8600,tyrion, m,tyrion," (Nods.) Yes, the king will be delighted to enjoy the company of a warrior as renowned as Prince Oberyn at his wedding feast.",1,4,23
8601,tyrion, m,tyrion, And where is Prince Oberyn?,1,4,5
8602,tyrion, m,tyrion," Very well. My lords, these fine men from the City Watch will escort you to your quarters in the Red Keep.",1,4,21
8603,tyrion, m,tyrion, You must be weary after such a long journey.,1,4,9
8604,tyrion, m,tyrion,  We must find Prince Oberyn before he kills somebody or several somebodies.,1,4,12
8605,tyrion, m,tyrion," You're famous for fucking half of Westeros. You just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad roads, where would you go?",1,4,23
8606,tyrion, m,tyrion," Prince Oberyn, forgive the intrusion. We heard there might be...",1,4,10
8607,tyrion, m,tyrion, trouble.,1,4,1
8608,tyrion, m,tyrion, I'm here to welcome you to the capital.,1,4,8
8609,tyrion, m,tyrion, If there's anything I can do to make your stay...,1,4,10
8610,tyrion, m,tyrion," Oh, I partook. Now I'm married.",1,4,6
8611,tyrion, m,tyrion," Prince Oberyn, if I may, a word in private?",1,4,9
8612,tyrion, m,tyrion," Oh, they take all kinds.",1,4,5
8613,tyrion, m,tyrion, The king is very grateful that you traveled all this way for his wedding.,1,4,14
8614,tyrion, m,tyrion," Well, speaking as a fellow second son, I have grown rather used to being the family insult.",1,4,17
8615,tyrion, m,tyrion," Why did you come to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn?",1,4,9
8616,tyrion, m,tyrion, I thought we were speaking truth.,1,4,6
8617,tyrion, m,tyrion, I wasn't actually present.,1,4,4
8618,tyrion, m,tyrion, I've heard rumors.,1,4,3
8619,tyrion, m,tyrion, I wasn't there. I don't know what happened.,1,4,8
8620,tyrion, m,tyrion," My lady, you do need to eat.",1,4,7
8621,tyrion, m,tyrion, If I could have a moment alone with my wife.,1,4,10
8622,tyrion, m,tyrion, I can't let you starve.,1,4,5
8623,tyrion, m,tyrion, I swore to protect you.,1,4,5
8624,tyrion, m,tyrion," My lady, I am your husband. Let me help you.",1,4,10
8625,tyrion, m,tyrion," I don't know, but I can try.",1,4,7
8626,tyrion, m,tyrion, I could get you essence of nightshade to help you sleep.,1,4,11
8627,tyrion, m,tyrion," What happened to your family was a terrible crime. I didn't know your brother. He seemed like a good man, but I didn't know him. Your mother, on the other hand, I admired her. She wanted to have me executed, but I admired her. She was a strong woman. And she was fierce when it came to protecting her children. Sansa. Your mother would want you to carry on. You know it's true.",1,4,73
8628,tyrion, m,tyrion," Of course. Of course. Prayer can be helpful, I hear.",1,4,10
8629,tyrion, m,tyrion, What are you doing?,1,4,4
8630,tyrion, m,tyrion, How many times have I told you? You can't visit me here.,1,4,12
8631,tyrion, m,tyrion, Of course I haven't forgotten.,1,4,5
8632,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Things are a bit tense right now.,1,4,7
8633,tyrion, m,tyrion, My nephew the king wants to murder me. My wife hates me because my father murdered her family. Oberyn Martell wants to murder everyone whose last name is Lannister.,1,4,29
8634,tyrion, m,tyrion, I told you. It's not a good time.,1,4,8
8635,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Shae.,1,4,1
8636,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Love her? I barely know her. She's a child. She despises me.,1,4,12
8637,tyrion, m,tyrion, Of course I don't love her.,1,4,6
8638,tyrion, m,tyrion, Ship you away?,1,4,3
8639,tyrion, m,tyrion,  What in the world are you talking about?,1,4,8
8640,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Shh. I don't know what you're talking about.,1,4,8
8641,tyrion, m,tyrion, Is that supposed to make me feel better?,4,4,8
8642,tyrion, m,tyrion," It's complicated, yes. So how is our sister?",4,4,8
8643,tyrion, m,tyrion, Her son?,4,4,2
8644,tyrion, m,tyrion," My trial for regicide.Yes, I know. I know the whole bloody country thinks I'm guilty. I know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count. And that judge is my father. As for Cersei, well, she's probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed.",4,4,58
8645,tyrion, m,tyrion," So, should I turn around and close my eyes?",4,4,9
8646,tyrion, m,tyrion, The Kingslayer brothers. You like it? I like it. You're really asking if I killed your son?,4,4,17
8647,tyrion, m,tyrion," Well, you could set me free.",4,4,6
8648,tyrion, m,tyrion, Then there's really nothing else to say.,4,4,7
8649,tyrion, m,tyrion," Sorry, I'd forgotten. I'd hate for you to do something inappropriate.",4,4,11
8650,tyrion, m,tyrion, Except I didn't do it.,4,4,5
8651,tyrion, m,tyrion, Sansa couldn't have done this. She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms. Do you think it's a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died?,4,4,28
8652,tyrion, m,tyrion," No, but... Sansa's not a killer. Not yet, anyway.",4,4,9
8653,tyrion, m,tyrion," Let me guess, I've been pardoned.",6,4,6
8654,tyrion, m,tyrion, Really?,6,4,1
8655,tyrion, m,tyrion," Well, we mustn't disappoint Father.",6,4,5
8656,tyrion, m,tyrion, No.,6,4,1
8657,tyrion, m,tyrion, Not that I know of.,6,4,5
8658,tyrion, m,tyrion, Choked on his pigeon pie.,6,4,5
8659,tyrion, m,tyrion, Or the pigeons. Just leave me out of it.,6,4,9
8660,tyrion, m,tyrion," Oh, why don't you tell them what Joffrey was doing?",6,4,10
8661,tyrion, m,tyrion, Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark while you tore at her clothes and beat her.,6,4,16
8662,tyrion, m,tyrion, (shakes his head),6,4,3
8663,tyrion, m,tyrion," Father, may I ask the witness one question?",6,4,8
8664,tyrion, m,tyrion," You once said that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat. You said the histories would never mention me, but you would not forget. Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?",6,4,31
8665,tyrion, m,tyrion," Not going well, is it?",6,4,5
8666,tyrion, m,tyrion," Oh, you think so?",6,4,4
8667,tyrion, m,tyrion, (nods),6,4,1
8668,tyrion, m,tyrion, Shae. Please don't.,6,4,3
8669,tyrion, m,tyrion," Father, I wish to confess. I wish... to confess.",6,4,9
8670,tyrion, m,tyrion, I saved you. I saved this city and all your worthless lives. I should have let Stannis kill you all.,6,4,20
8671,tyrion, m,tyrion," Yes, Father. I'm guilty. Guilty. Is that what you want to hear?",6,4,12
8672,tyrion, m,tyrion," No, of that I'm innocent. I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime. I am guilty of being a dwarf.",6,4,20
8673,tyrion, m,tyrion," Oh, yes, I am. I've been on trial for that my entire life.",6,4,13
8674,tyrion, m,tyrion," (To Cersei) Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1,000 lying whores.",6,4,15
8675,tyrion, m,tyrion, (To the crowd) I wish I was the monster you think I am. I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you. I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it.,6,4,37
8676,tyrion, m,tyrion, I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder. And I know I'll get no justice here. So I will let the gods decide my fate. I demand a trial by combat.,6,4,32
8677,tyrion, m,tyrion," I'm sorry, what am I grateful for? The opportunity to live and die at the Wall as punishment for a crime I did not commit?",7,4,25
8678,tyrion, m,tyrion," Yes, I fell in love with a whore. And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me. That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted. You do see that? He gets you back as his heir. The future Lord of the Rock. And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last. All so perfect. It felt good to take that from him. He knows I'm innocent and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway. He's willing to sacrifice any of us. Not you. You're the golden son. You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, you'll always be the golden son.",7,4,115
8679,tyrion, m,tyrion, At least I got to tell them what they really are.,7,4,11
8680,tyrion, m,tyrion," Don't give up on me just yet. I survived one trial by combat, even though you weren't there to save me.",7,4,21
8681,tyrion, m,tyrion," Where's your sense of adventure? Even if you lose, imagine the look on Father's face when you fall.",7,4,18
8682,tyrion, m,tyrion, Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword.,7,4,12
8683,tyrion, m,tyrion," Well... Bronn fought for me once, he'll do it again. If he wins, I expect I'll be in his debt for the rest of my life.",7,4,26
8684,tyrion, m,tyrion, Will you find him for me? Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion? I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant. I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater.,7,4,30
8685,tyrion, m,tyrion, You have new clothes.,7,4,4
8686,tyrion, m,tyrion, I sent for you days ago.,7,4,6
8687,tyrion, m,tyrion, Doing what?,7,4,2
8688,tyrion, m,tyrion, Lollys Stokeworth? She doesn't strike me as your sort of girl.,7,4,11
8689,tyrion, m,tyrion, She's dim-witted.,7,4,2
8690,tyrion, m,tyrion," When my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister?",7,4,16
8691,tyrion, m,tyrion, And you understand the rules of inheritance?,7,4,7
8692,tyrion, m,tyrion, She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies.,7,4,9
8693,tyrion, m,tyrion, (scoffs.),7,4,1
8694,tyrion, m,tyrion, You and my sister deserve each other. Why did you bother to come here?,7,4,14
8695,tyrion, m,tyrion, Is it two wives you want or two castles?,7,4,9
8696,tyrion, m,tyrion, I'm a bit short on castles at the moment. But I can offer you gold and gratitude.,7,4,17
8697,tyrion, m,tyrion, You might be surprised. A Lannister always pays his debts.,7,4,10
8698,tyrion, m,tyrion," My wife is heir to Winterfell. If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rule the North in her name. I could carve you out a big piece of it.",7,4,38
8699,tyrion, m,tyrion, Does he frighten you so much?,7,4,6
8700,tyrion, m,tyrion, Because you're my friend.,7,4,4
8701,tyrion, m,tyrion, I understand.,7,4,2
8702,tyrion, m,tyrion, Why are you sorry? Because you're an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart? That's what I liked about you in the first place.,7,4,25
8703,tyrion, m,tyrion," Yes, we did.",7,4,3
8704,tyrion, m,tyrion, I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself. Won't that make for a great song?,7,4,16
8705,tyrion, m,tyrion, I imagined you'd be back at the brothel at this hour.,7,4,11
8706,tyrion, m,tyrion," Mm, do tell. I've got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like.",7,4,16
8707,tyrion, m,tyrion, Oh.,7,4,1
8708,tyrion, m,tyrion, Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.,7,4,12
8709,tyrion, m,tyrion, She didn't need to bother you. It looks as though I've taken care of that myself. The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck. She's wanted this for a long time.,7,4,34
8710,tyrion, m,tyrion, I think I would have remembered that.,7,4,7
8711,tyrion, m,tyrion, You and my family have more in common than you might admit.,7,4,12
8712,tyrion, m,tyrion, That would have made things so much easier.,7,4,8
8713,tyrion, m,tyrion," Well... sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants.",7,4,10
8714,tyrion, m,tyrion," If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place.",7,4,10
8715,tyrion, m,tyrion, The smaller man it is.,9,5,5
8716,tyrion, m,tyrion, There’s always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. I can do without it in my leisure time.,9,5,22
8717,tyrion, m,tyrion, It’s easy to confuse what is with what ought to be. Especially when what is has worked in your favor.,9,5,20
8718,tyrion, m,tyrion, My father would have liked you.,9,5,6
8719,tyrion, m,tyrion," Well said, you’re an eloquent man. Doesn’t mean you’re wrong. In my experience, eloquent men are right every bit as often as imbeciles.",9,5,23
8720,tyrion, m,tyrion, You can end this.,9,5,4
8721,tyrion, m,tyrion, You can!,9,5,2
8722,tyrion, m,tyrion, Stay close!,9,5,2
8723,tyrion, m,tyrion, If only I were otherwise.,8,5,5
8724,tyrion, m,tyrion, You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born. I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart. I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.,8,5,38
8725,tyrion, m,tyrion, Into your service? Your Grace we have only just met. It’s too soon to know if you deserve my service.,8,5,20
8726,tyrion, m,tyrion," When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory. She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that. And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time, along with three dragons. He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world. I thought you were worth meeting at the very least.",8,5,155
8727,tyrion, m,tyrion, Because you can not build a better world on your own. You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule. The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you.,8,5,41
8728,tyrion, m,tyrion, Killing and politics aren’t always the same thing. When I served as Hand of the King I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people. I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name.,8,5,48
8729,tyrion, m,tyrion, I know.,8,5,2
8730,tyrion, m,tyrion," Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man. I can’t remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you. He claims he would kill for you and die for you, and nothing I have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him. And yet he did betray you.",8,5,61
8731,tyrion, m,tyrion, Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals?,8,5,9
8732,tyrion, m,tyrion, And did he?,8,5,3
8733,tyrion, m,tyrion," A ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion. And you’re going to need to inspire devotion, and lots of it, if you’re ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea. But you cannot have him by your side when you do.",8,5,50
8734,tyrion, m,tyrion, Have you decided yet whether you’re going to have me killed?,8,5,11
8735,tyrion, m,tyrion, I can see why you would think so. It’s what your father would have done.,8,5,15
8736,tyrion, m,tyrion, My father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? I’d say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.,8,5,19
8737,tyrion, m,tyrion," Some day if you decide not to execute me, I’ll tell you all about why I killed my father. And on that day, should it ever come, we’ll need more wine than this.",8,5,33
8738,tyrion, m,tyrion," So here we sit, two terrible children of two terrible fathers.",8,5,11
8739,tyrion, m,tyrion, I’ve heard stories.,8,5,3
8740,tyrion, m,tyrion, To see if you were the right kind of terrible.,8,5,10
8741,tyrion, m,tyrion, The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.,8,5,11
8742,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Yes, that was wise. And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good. Very impressive. My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, Gods forbid. She ended up having him killed.",8,5,46
8743,tyrion, m,tyrion, It’s not impossible that Varys was right about you after all.,8,5,11
8744,tyrion, m,tyrion, Yes. He was the one who convinced me to come find you. He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.,8,5,25
8745,tyrion, m,tyrion, He did what he had to do to survive. He did a lot of other things that he didn’t have to do. I suspect he’s the main reason you weren’t slaughtered in your crib.,8,5,34
8746,tyrion, m,tyrion," Yes, oddly. He might be the only person in the world that I trust. Besides my brother.",8,5,17
8747,tyrion, m,tyrion, That’s the one.,8,5,3
8748,tyrion, m,tyrion," Your queenly prerogative. I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for. You chop off my head? Well, my final days were interesting.",8,5,30
8749,tyrion, m,tyrion, No? Banish me?,8,5,3
8750,tyrion, m,tyrion," So if I’m not going to be murdered, and I’m not going to be banished...",8,5,15
8751,tyrion, m,tyrion, Advise you on what?,8,5,4
8752,tyrion, m,tyrion, The Iron Throne. Perhaps you should try wanting something else.,8,5,10
8753,tyrion, m,tyrion, I’m not entirely joking. There’s more to the world than Westeros after all. How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong. Where you can do the most good.,8,5,40
8754,tyrion, m,tyrion," And when you get back to your home, who supports you?",8,5,11
8755,tyrion, m,tyrion," Let’s be generous and assume that’s going to happen. Here in Slaver’s Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people. What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that. The remaining Lannisters won’t back you, not ever. Stannis Baratheon won’t back you either, his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours. That leaves the Tyrells. Not impossible, but not enough.",8,5,99
8756,tyrion, m,tyrion, It’s a beautiful dream. Stopping the wheel. You’re not the first person to have dreamt it.,8,5,16
8757,tyrion, m,tyrion," You love her, don’t you? How could you not. Of course, it’s hopeless for the both of you. Sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight. Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen. But, we always want the wrong woman.",10,5,43
8758,tyrion, m,tyrion, Dwarf. I believe that’s the word. Apologies. My Valyrian is a bit “nostril”.,10,5,13
8759,tyrion, m,tyrion, (Valyrian) “Rusty” (Common Tongue) Thank you.,10,5,6
8760,tyrion, m,tyrion," He’s right. The dragon headed north. If we’re going to find her, that’s where we’re to go.",10,5,17
8761,tyrion, m,tyrion, And I intend to help her do it.,10,5,8
8762,tyrion, m,tyrion, You betrayed her!,10,5,3
8763,tyrion, m,tyrion," And she exiled you, twice, I believe?",10,5,7
8764,tyrion, m,tyrion," Don’t blame me for your crimes, Mormont.",10,5,7
8765,tyrion, m,tyrion," Fine, fine, I suppose he can join us. Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep.",10,5,21
8766,tyrion, m,tyrion, Pardon me?,10,5,2
8767,tyrion, m,tyrion," Not precisely, but I have other skills that’d be very useful--",10,5,11
8768,tyrion, m,tyrion, I have fought. I don’t claim to be a great warrior.,10,5,11
8769,tyrion, m,tyrion, Middling.,10,5,1
8770,tyrion, m,tyrion, And drink. I’ve survived so far.,10,5,6
8771,tyrion, m,tyrion, I suppose there’s no point in asking how you found me.,10,5,11
8772,tyrion, m,tyrion," Well, she didn’t execute me, so that’s a promising start. Now the heroes are off to find her, and I’m stuck here, trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war. Any advice for an old comrade?",10,5,39
8773,tyrion, m,tyrion, If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.,10,5,11
8774,tyrion, m,tyrion, I did miss you.,10,5,4
8775,tyrion, m,tyrion, I have to get out of this wheelhouse.,3,5,8
8776,tyrion, m,tyrion, I have to get out of this wheelhouse.,3,5,8
8777,tyrion, m,tyrion," Mm, I have to get out of this wheelhouse.",3,5,9
8778,tyrion, m,tyrion, (Walks over to him). I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen if I lose my mind. I can't remember the last face I saw that wasn't yours.,3,5,30
8779,tyrion, m,tyrion, I'm losing my mind.,3,5,4
8780,tyrion, m,tyrion," Look, we are thousands of miles from Westeros. (Pulls his hood up). What am I? (Varys shakes his head). One more drunk dwarf.",3,5,23
8781,tyrion, m,tyrion, Slaves.,3,5,1
8782,tyrion, m,tyrion, The only red priest we had in King's Landing was Thoros of Myr. This one's much better looking.,3,5,18
8783,tyrion, m,tyrion, Stone men. Good luck stopping this spread of grayscale with prayer. You'd have better luck dancing away the plague. (Varys shushes him worriedly).,3,5,23
8784,tyrion, m,tyrion, We're going to meet the Saviour! You should have told me. Who doesn't want to meet the Saviour?,3,5,18
8785,tyrion, m,tyrion, (Covering his face). Come on. Let's find a brothel.,3,5,9
8786,tyrion, m,tyrion, It's even better luck to suck a dwarf's cock.,3,5,9
8787,tyrion, m,tyrion," See? We blend right in. Just two more travellers, mad with lust.",3,5,12
8788,tyrion, m,tyrion, Curious... hair. (She looks at him).,3,5,6
8789,tyrion, m,tyrion, It appears you're not the only Targaryen supporter.,3,5,8
8790,tyrion, m,tyrion," Well, (Watches her kiss the man), she's taken.",3,5,8
8791,tyrion, m,tyrion, I need to speak to someone with hair.,3,5,8
8792,tyrion, m,tyrion, Hello?,3,5,1
8793,tyrion, m,tyrion, You've got no drink.,3,5,4
8794,tyrion, m,tyrion," Do I look like a man without money? (She looks at him incredulously). Never trust looks. Until quite recently, I was one of the richest men in the world. (She laughs). But who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh? (Sits down). I always pay my debts, I'm well known for it.",3,5,54
8795,tyrion, m,tyrion, That’s because they’ve never met a queen.,3,5,7
8796,tyrion, m,tyrion," You know how to spot a liar. If I could pick any girl here, I would pick you.",3,5,18
8797,tyrion, m,tyrion, Because you have a skeptical mind.,3,5,6
8798,tyrion, m,tyrion," (After a moment). I'm, I'm sorry, I can't.",3,5,8
8799,tyrion, m,tyrion, I'm not.,3,5,2
8800,tyrion, m,tyrion," Gladly, but this, I can't do. Believe me, no one is more shocked than I am. I hope it passes. What will I do in my spare time? I’ll go for a piss, that’s a start.",3,5,36
8801,tyrion, m,tyrion, You made some kind of mistake. Why don't you tell me what you think you are doing and -,3,5,19
8802,tyrion, m,tyrion, There's a bug.,2,5,3
8803,tyrion, m,tyrion," When I agreed to come with you, did I misrepresent my intentions? (finishes his cup of wine) Besides, what is there for me to do inside this fucking box?",2,5,29
8804,tyrion, m,tyrion, I want to take a walk.,2,5,6
8805,tyrion, m,tyrion," She ought to offer her cunt. Best part of her for the best part of me. Well, I suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere.",2,5,30
8806,tyrion, m,tyrion, You're right. No point. (realizing) The road to Volantis? You said we were going to Meereen. What's in Volantis?,2,5,19
8807,tyrion, m,tyrion, And what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen?,2,5,15
8808,tyrion, m,tyrion, We've already got a ruler. Everywhere has already got a ruler. Every pile of shit on the side of every road has someone's banner hanging from it.,2,5,27
8809,tyrion, m,tyrion, I didn't rule. I was a servant.,2,5,7
8810,tyrion, m,tyrion, Managed to kill a lot of people.,2,5,7
8811,tyrion, m,tyrion, She wanted me to leave King's Landing. She begged me. I wouldn't go.,2,5,13
8812,tyrion, m,tyrion, 'Cause I liked it. Power. Even as a servant. (takes a drink of wine),2,5,14
8813,tyrion, m,tyrion, I find us repulsive.,2,5,4
8814,tyrion, m,tyrion, You're right. Let's go for a walk.,2,5,7
8815,tyrion, m,tyrion, How many dwarves are there in the world? Is Cersei going to kill them all?,2,5,15
8816,tyrion, m,tyrion, I still don’t see why I had to stay in this fucking crate once we set sail.,1,5,17
8817,tyrion, m,tyrion, Do you know what it’s like to stuff your shit through one of those air holes?,1,5,16
8818,tyrion, m,tyrion, Pentos?,1,5,1
8819,tyrion, m,tyrion, Much better.,1,5,2
8820,tyrion, m,tyrion, I don’t think I am anymore. A lord. Are you a lord if you kill your father? I don’t suppose they revoke your nobility for killing a whore. That has to be happen all the time.,1,5,36
8821,tyrion, m,tyrion, In a box. Why stop now?,1,5,6
8822,tyrion, m,tyrion, The future is shit. Just like the past.,1,5,8
8823,tyrion, m,tyrion," Eunuch, the spider, the master of whisperers.",1,5,7
8824,tyrion, m,tyrion, Not for a coward.,1,5,4
8825,tyrion, m,tyrion, You never told me why you set me free.,1,5,9
8826,tyrion, m,tyrion, You could have said no.,1,5,5
8827,tyrion, m,tyrion," Not as dangerous as releasing me. You risked your life, your position, everything. Why? You’re not family, you owe me nothing.",1,5,21
8828,tyrion, m,tyrion, A drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.,1,5,12
8829,tyrion, m,tyrion, You’re going to have to find another soldier. I’m done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me.,1,5,18
8830,tyrion, m,tyrion, I’m not well-suited for work.,1,5,5
8831,tyrion, m,tyrion, Compassion? Yes. I killed my lover with my bare hands. I shot my own father with a crossbow.,1,5,18
8832,tyrion, m,tyrion, What is it you want exactly?,1,5,6
8833,tyrion, m,tyrion," Where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine. The powerful have always preyed on the powerless, that’s how they became powerful in the first place.",1,5,32
8834,tyrion, m,tyrion, I will never sit on the Iron Throne.,1,5,8
8835,tyrion, m,tyrion, Good luck finding him.,1,5,4
8836,tyrion, m,tyrion, Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen?,1,5,11
8837,tyrion, m,tyrion," Don't worry. I'll be fine. Nothing broken, I don't think. Where are we now? Not the Rhoyne. (No response). Long, sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face. The Mormont way. Let's start over. I apologize for before. My mouth sometimes runs away from me. This doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip. We're going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to Meereen.",5,5,69
8838,tyrion, m,tyrion, What would make our time together truly enjoyable would be some wine.,5,5,12
8839,tyrion, m,tyrion," I am a person who drinks. People who drink need to keep drinking. Otherwise, they're not…",5,5,16
8840,tyrion, m,tyrion, I know where we are. You're taking us through Valyria.,5,5,10
8841,tyrion, m,tyrion, Have you sailed this route before?,5,5,6
8842,tyrion, m,tyrion, You're going to bring Daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case I'm not enough?,5,5,16
8843,tyrion, m,tyrion, You know what they say. The Doom still rules Valyria. What about the demons and the flames? Aren't you afraid of the Doom?,5,5,23
8844,tyrion, m,tyrion, Oh.,5,5,1
8845,tyrion, m,tyrion, The Smoking Sea. How many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again? Thousands of years the Valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything. And then -,5,5,33
8846,tyrion, m,tyrion," And then they weren't. ""They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end. The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies; The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned; Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes. A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned -""",5,5,65
8847,tyrion, m,tyrion, I would clap.,5,5,3
8848,tyrion, m,tyrion," I suppose this is it, then. This is what remains.",5,5,10
8849,tyrion, m,tyrion, What was that?,5,5,3
8850,tyrion, m,tyrion," Mormont, cut me free! (Jorah falls into the water). Mormont!",5,5,10
8851,tyrion, m,tyrion, Mormont! Mormont!,5,5,2
8852,tyrion, m,tyrion," (Shakes his head). You? (Jorah shakes his head). I've seen greyscale before, but nothing like that.",5,5,16
8853,tyrion, m,tyrion," It'd be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it. (Jorah spits). Thank you for saving me. Of course, I wouldn't have needed saving if you hadn't kidnapped me in the first place. (Jorah gets up). So what now?",5,5,43
8854,tyrion, m,tyrion, Without luck?,5,5,2
8855,tyrion, m,tyrion, That's the best idea you've had all day.,5,5,8
8856,tyrion, m,tyrion, Thank you. (After a long pause). Who are you?,4,5,9
8857,tyrion, m,tyrion, Do you have wine?,4,5,4
8858,tyrion, m,tyrion, I can't sleep without wine.,4,5,5
8859,tyrion, m,tyrion, You're going the wrong way. My sister's in Westeros. Westeros is west! We're heading east.,4,5,15
8860,tyrion, m,tyrion, You said you were taking me to the Queen.,4,5,9
8861,tyrion, m,tyrion, (Chuckles). What a waste of a good kidnapping. So happens I was heading there myself!,4,5,15
8862,tyrion, m,tyrion," Gold and glory. Oh, and hate. If you've ever met my sister, you'd understand. So now that it's clear we're on the same side? (Holds out his hands expectantly. Jorah makes no move to respond). A high born knight from the North of Westeros, down on his luck in Essos. Dragon epaulettes? Bear sigil breast plate. You're Jorah Mormont. I have to ask how, exactly, were you serving your Queen in a whore house, half a world away? Is it possible, that you were running? Why would you be running? And why would she have sent you away? Oh, wait! You were spying on her, weren't you? It's all coming back to me! I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings, but it's all coming back. You passed notes to Varys's little birds. She found out, didn't she? Found out, and exiled you. (Jorah looks downtrodden). And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift. A risky scheme. One might even say, desperate. Do you think Daenerys would execute me, and pardon you? I'd say the reverse is just as likely.",4,5,186
8863,tyrion, m,tyrion," So, those villages we were supposed to find. We can’t live on berries and roots.",6,5,15
8864,tyrion, m,tyrion, You’re not hungry?,6,5,3
8865,tyrion, m,tyrion," You’re an awful travelling companion, do you know that? Possibly the least charming man I have ever met.",6,5,18
8866,tyrion, m,tyrion, We are travelling together. In each other’s company. Therefore…,6,5,9
8867,tyrion, m,tyrion, I sailed from King’s Landing to Pentos in a crate. Without ever saying a word.,6,5,15
8868,tyrion, m,tyrion, Never occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis.,6,5,22
8869,tyrion, m,tyrion, I killed my father. He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn’t commit. And he was fucking the woman I loved.,6,5,23
8870,tyrion, m,tyrion," As miserable as you are, Mormont, at least your father was a good man.",6,5,14
8871,tyrion, m,tyrion," I met him. I visited the Wall. When I asked him about his men he knew all the stories, every one of them. He actually cared about the people in his command. How did they put it in the Watch? “We shall never see his like again.”",6,5,47
8872,tyrion, m,tyrion, You didn’t know. I’m sorry. I am.,6,5,7
8873,tyrion, m,tyrion, I only know what I heard,6,5,6
8874,tyrion, m,tyrion, He was leading an expedition beyond the wall. There was a mutiny. He was murdered by his own men.,6,5,19
8875,tyrion, m,tyrion," Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this? As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert’s Rebellion.",6,5,20
8876,tyrion, m,tyrion, I believe in many things.,6,5,5
8877,tyrion, m,tyrion, No.,6,5,1
8878,tyrion, m,tyrion, No.,6,5,1
8879,tyrion, m,tyrion, Doesn’t mean she’s going to be a great queen.,6,5,9
8880,tyrion, m,tyrion," The Targaryens are famously insane. What if she conquers the world? Then what? 1,000 years of peace and prosperity?",6,5,19
8881,tyrion, m,tyrion," We? Alright, let’s assume your dreams come true. She’s ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf. She hacks off my head and restores your position. You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies, then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the Iron Throne. Hurrah, long live the Queen. Then what?",6,5,57
8882,tyrion, m,tyrion, So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That’s justice?,6,5,23
8883,tyrion, m,tyrion," Why, because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king?",6,5,13
8884,tyrion, m,tyrion, Why is it anchored?,6,5,4
8885,tyrion, m,tyrion," Wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, let’s discuss this!",6,5,8
8886,tyrion, m,tyrion," Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can’t just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it. He has to know it came from a dwarf. And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?",6,5,40
8887,tyrion, m,tyrion, Guess again.,6,5,2
8888,tyrion, m,tyrion," The fighting puts in Mereen! You’re in luck then, you’re about to be rich. You are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms.",6,5,27
8889,tyrion, m,tyrion, (looks at Jorah) Him.,6,5,4
8890,tyrion, m,tyrion," Sure, he’s a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long. We can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles. They wrote songs about him!",6,5,35
8891,tyrion, m,tyrion," He won the tournament at Lannisport, unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself.",6,5,11
8892,tyrion, m,tyrion, The Kingslayer!,6,5,2
8893,tyrion, m,tyrion, Wait! You have to buy me as well.,7,5,8
8894,tyrion, m,tyrion," We’re a team. I’m a great fighter, too.",7,5,8
8895,tyrion, m,tyrion, Thank you my Lord. Thank you.,7,5,6
8896,tyrion, m,tyrion," My Lord, if I may. I’ve heard Mereen’s become a free city. You might run into trouble if you try to fight slaves in the fighting pits. Now if you were to fight free men who were paid a wage…",7,5,40
8897,tyrion, m,tyrion, What are you doing?,7,5,4
8898,tyrion, m,tyrion, It’s true. He has.,7,5,4
8899,tyrion, m,tyrion," I am the gift. It’s a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace. My name is Tyrion Lannister.",7,5,17
8900,tyrion, m,tyrion," If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find. Of course I'm afraid.",9,2,16
8901,tyrion, m,tyrion, I'm a Lannister. I don't have a choice in all this. But it's not your war.,9,2,16
8902,tyrion, m,tyrion, You can't fuck your way out of everything.,9,2,8
8903,tyrion, m,tyrion, A wedding.,9,2,2
8904,tyrion, m,tyrion," ""Is that it?"" Nice touch. As if you don't know the name of every boy in town.",9,2,17
8905,tyrion, m,tyrion, I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure what I'm suggesting.,9,2,9
8906,tyrion, m,tyrion," Oddly enough, I do.",9,2,4
8907,tyrion, m,tyrion, There must be 20 miles of tunnels beneath the city.,9,2,10
8908,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  I'm not escaping. Strange as it sounds, I'm the captain of the ship, and if the ship goes down, I go with her.",9,2,23
8909,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Well, I'm not.",9,2,3
8910,tyrion, m,tyrion, What of it?,9,2,3
8911,tyrion, m,tyrion," Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting. What do you think?",9,2,8
8912,tyrion, m,tyrion," Mmm, don't take it personally. I don't entirely trust myself.",9,2,10
8913,tyrion, m,tyrion," No, I don't believe you have.",9,2,6
8914,tyrion, m,tyrion," Remember, wait till the ships",9,2,5
8915,tyrion, m,tyrion, They must be far enough in,9,2,6
8916,tyrion, m,tyrion," I chopped wood once. No, I watched my brother chopping wood.",9,2,11
8917,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Nor you, my friend.",9,2,4
8918,tyrion, m,tyrion, Of course we are. Just because I pay you for your services doesn't diminish our friendship.,9,2,16
8919,tyrion, m,tyrion," Oh! ""Enhances."" Fancy word for a sellsword.",9,2,7
8920,tyrion, m,tyrion, Lady Sansa and Sheila.,9,2,4
8921,tyrion, m,tyrion," Shae, yes. Surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegor's holdfast.",9,2,17
8922,tyrion, m,tyrion," Always been a great romantic, my nephew.",9,2,7
8923,tyrion, m,tyrion, Will you?,9,2,2
8924,tyrion, m,tyrion," Stay safe, my lady.",9,2,4
8925,tyrion, m,tyrion, On the way.,9,2,3
8926,tyrion, m,tyrion," That would make me the quarterman. It just doesn't have the same ring to it. Cut me in half and I won't be able to give the signal. No signal, no plan. No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere. It might be quite amusing, except that my head would be up there, too. I've never much liked my head, but I don't want to see it removed just yet.",9,2,83
8927,tyrion, m,tyrion, Archers to their marks.,9,2,4
8928,tyrion, m,tyrion, Hold fast.,9,2,2
8929,tyrion, m,tyrion, Hold fast.,9,2,2
8930,tyrion, m,tyrion," He's a serious man, Stannis Baratheon.",9,2,6
8931,tyrion, m,tyrion, Rain fire on them.,9,2,4
8932,tyrion, m,tyrion," Hound, form a welcome party for any Baratheon troop that manages to touch solid ground. Pod, run to the King's Gate. Bring any men guarding it here, now.",9,2,28
8933,tyrion, m,tyrion," Can I get you some iced milk and a nice bowl of raspberries, too?",9,2,14
8934,tyrion, m,tyrion, You're on the wrong side of the wall.,9,2,8
8935,tyrion, m,tyrion," You're Kingsguard, Clegane. You must beat them back or they're going to take this city. Your king's city.",9,2,18
8936,tyrion, m,tyrion," If you won't defend your own city, why should they?",9,2,10
8937,tyrion, m,tyrion, Lead. Get down there and lead your people against the invaders who want to kill them.,9,2,16
8938,tyrion, m,tyrion, I'll lead the attack. I'll lead the attack!,9,2,8
8939,tyrion, m,tyrion," Pod, my helmet. Ser Mandon, you will bear the king's banner. Men, form up. Men Men! They say I'm half a man. But what does that make the lot of you?",9,2,31
8940,tyrion, m,tyrion, There's another way out. I'm going to show you. We'll come out behind them and fuck them in their arses.,9,2,20
8941,tyrion, m,tyrion," Don't fight for your king and don't fight for his kingdoms. Don't fight for honor. Don't fight for glory. Don't fight for riches, because you won't get any. This is your city Stannis means to sack. That's your gate he's ramming. If he gets in, it will be your houses he burns, your gold he steals, your women he will rape.",9,2,61
8942,tyrion, m,tyrion, Those are brave men knocking at our door. Let's go kill them.,9,2,12
8943,tyrion, m,tyrion, Attack!,9,2,1
8944,tyrion, m,tyrion," Oh, fuck me.",9,2,3
8945,tyrion, m,tyrion," Yes, but do you have to do it here?",8,2,9
8946,tyrion, m,tyrion, You should start wearing the gold cloak.,8,2,7
8947,tyrion, m,tyrion, You're commander of the City Watch. You shouldn't be dressed like a common,8,2,13
8948,tyrion, m,tyrion," Well, you're not sneaking through alleyways any longer. You're supposed to stand out.",8,2,13
8949,tyrion, m,tyrion," Fine, fine. No gold cloak.",8,2,5
8950,tyrion, m,tyrion, What?,8,2,1
8951,tyrion, m,tyrion, What? What? Why are you staring at me?,8,2,8
8952,tyrion, m,tyrion, To help me plan the defense of King's Landing.,8,2,9
8953,tyrion, m,tyrion, Stannis will be here any day.,8,2,6
8954,tyrion, m,tyrion," ""An History of the Great Sieges of Westeros. "" By Archmaester Shevelathin. Shevelatesh.",8,2,13
8955,tyrion, m,tyrion, I did not know. And how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery?,8,2,14
8956,tyrion, m,tyrion, For questioning?,8,2,2
8957,tyrion, m,tyrion, We talked about this.,8,2,4
8958,tyrion, m,tyrion," Stannis knows King's Landing. He knows where the walls are strongest, and he knows which gates are weakest. The Mud Gate. A good ram will batter it down in minutes, and it's only 50 yards from the water. That's where he'll land.",8,2,42
8959,tyrion, m,tyrion, Pig shit.,8,2,2
8960,tyrion, m,tyrion," Thank you, Podrick.",8,2,3
8961,tyrion, m,tyrion, I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys.,8,2,9
8962,tyrion, m,tyrion, Excellent lamprey pie. Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day? I hear Joffrey plans on fighting. An inspiration for the troops. The young king in his shining armor fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old rebel.,8,2,40
8963,tyrion, m,tyrion, Younger boys are off fighting his war.,8,2,7
8964,tyrion, m,tyrion," What is he, 17? Remember Jaime at 17?",8,2,8
8965,tyrion, m,tyrion," It's not on the throne, either, sadly for all of us.",8,2,11
8966,tyrion, m,tyrion," No, I'd say you possess above-average intelligence.",8,2,7
8967,tyrion, m,tyrion, He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him. He has the finest armor gold can buy. He needs to be out there. The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts. Any dessert?,8,2,41
8968,tyrion, m,tyrion, Because he has thousands of spies in his employ. Because he knows everything we do before we do it.,8,2,19
8969,tyrion, m,tyrion, Neither do you.,8,2,3
8970,tyrion, m,tyrion, It's not that little.,8,2,4
8971,tyrion, m,tyrion, Why are you smiling?,8,2,4
8972,tyrion, m,tyrion, And why are you happy?,8,2,5
8973,tyrion, m,tyrion, I thought you preferred blondes.,8,2,5
8974,tyrion, m,tyrion, Why do you care who I fuck?,8,2,7
8975,tyrion, m,tyrion, This is madness. Stannis will be here in days. You need me.,8,2,12
8976,tyrion, m,tyrion, Where did you find her?,8,2,5
8977,tyrion, m,tyrion, You've forgotten the most important thing about whores.,8,2,8
8978,tyrion, m,tyrion," You don't buy them, you only rent them.",8,2,8
8979,tyrion, m,tyrion, And how do I know you haven't killed her already?,8,2,10
8980,tyrion, m,tyrion, I'm sorry they hurt you. You must be brave.,8,2,9
8981,tyrion, m,tyrion, I promise I will free you.,8,2,6
8982,tyrion, m,tyrion, Never.,8,2,1
8983,tyrion, m,tyrion," I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you're safe and happy, and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth. And you will know the debt is paid.",8,2,35
8984,tyrion, m,tyrion, Shae!,8,2,1
8985,tyrion, m,tyrion, We have to be more careful.,8,2,6
8986,tyrion, m,tyrion, There are people who want to hurt me.,8,2,8
8987,tyrion, m,tyrion, I would kill for you. Do you know that? I expect I'll have to before this is over. You're mine.,8,2,20
8988,tyrion, m,tyrion, Promise me.,8,2,2
8989,tyrion, m,tyrion," To strike? My dear nephew, you do see these men preparing the walls for siege? You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way?",8,2,23
8990,tyrion, m,tyrion," A brave choice, Your Grace. I'm sure your men will line up behind you.",8,2,14
8991,tyrion, m,tyrion, Imagine Stannis' terror.,8,2,3
8992,tyrion, m,tyrion, You're an intelligent man. I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.,8,2,12
8993,tyrion, m,tyrion," I wish we could converse as two honest, intelligent men.",8,2,10
8994,tyrion, m,tyrion, What do you want? Tell me.,8,2,6
8995,tyrion, m,tyrion," My brother was the youngest Kingsguard in history. My sister became queen at the age of 19. When I reached manhood, my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in Casterly Rock.",8,2,36
8996,tyrion, m,tyrion, The water never flowed better. And all the shit found its way to the sea. I never expected to have any real power. So when my father named me acting Hand,8,2,31
8997,tyrion, m,tyrion,  I do. Last thing I expected.,8,2,6
8998,tyrion, m,tyrion," I'd like to keep playing it. If Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over.",8,2,15
8999,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned, the Drowned God wants them drowned. Why are all the gods such vicious cunts? Where is the god of tits and wine?",8,2,30
9000,tyrion, m,tyrion, We should sail there immediately.,8,2,5
9001,tyrion, m,tyrion, A girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems.,8,2,14
9002,tyrion, m,tyrion," One game at a time, my friend.",8,2,7
9003,tyrion, m,tyrion, Pod.,10,2,1
9004,tyrion, m,tyrion, Pod! Find Bronn or Varys. Tell them I am here with Maester Pycelle. Tell them I am very much alive.,10,2,20
9005,tyrion, m,tyrion, What happened?,10,2,2
9006,tyrion, m,tyrion, Where am I?,10,2,3
9007,tyrion, m,tyrion, Why should I believe you?,10,2,5
9008,tyrion, m,tyrion, To create strife between my sister and me.,10,2,8
9009,tyrion, m,tyrion, Pod.,10,2,1
9010,tyrion, m,tyrion, Would it be excessive of me to ask you to save my life twice in a week?,10,2,17
9011,tyrion, m,tyrion," You're a good lad. Get Bronn, tell him I want four of his most loyal gold cloaks outside my door at all times.",10,2,23
9012,tyrion, m,tyrion, Then my hill tribesmen.,10,2,4
9013,tyrion, m,tyrion, Don't want to swim too close to a drowning man? And I thought we were friends.,10,2,16
9014,tyrion, m,tyrion, It was good of you to come.,10,2,7
9015,tyrion, m,tyrion," Believe me, you don't.",10,2,4
9016,tyrion, m,tyrion, (shakes his head),10,2,3
9017,tyrion, m,tyrion, Well?,10,2,1
9018,tyrion, m,tyrion, I'm a monster as well as a dwarf. You should charge me double.,10,2,13
9019,tyrion, m,tyrion, That was the arrangement we made. I pay you and you lie to me.,10,2,14
9020,tyrion, m,tyrion, Leave?,10,2,1
9021,tyrion, m,tyrion, What would we do in Pentos?,10,2,6
9022,tyrion, m,tyrion, I want to go with you.,10,2,6
9023,tyrion, m,tyrion," I can't. I do belong here. These bad people are what I'm good at. Outtalking them, outthinking them. It's what I am. And I like it. I like it more than anything I've ever done. Are you going to leave?",10,2,40
9024,tyrion, m,tyrion, Keep your voice down.,3,2,4
9025,tyrion, m,tyrion," I don't intend for you to stay here. I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens. Again, only temporary.",3,2,22
9026,tyrion, m,tyrion, But you wouldn't be a cook. You'd pose as a scullion.,3,2,11
9027,tyrion, m,tyrion, Kitchen wench.,3,2,2
9028,tyrion, m,tyrion," Yes, but",3,2,2
9029,tyrion, m,tyrion, Your lion wants to see you alive. We've come to a dangerous place. My sister wants to hurt me. She'll look for any weakness she can find. She can't know about you.,3,2,32
9030,tyrion, m,tyrion," It's a compliment, my lady.",3,2,5
9031,tyrion, m,tyrion, Language can be a bit tricky here.,3,2,7
9032,tyrion, m,tyrion, Oh! Thank the gods. I haven't had a proper shit in six days.,3,2,13
9033,tyrion, m,tyrion, Right. I'm so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side.,3,2,17
9034,tyrion, m,tyrion," I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?",3,2,8
9035,tyrion, m,tyrion, These are perilous times. And the crown must forge new alliances. And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony.,3,2,20
9036,tyrion, m,tyrion," I'm trusting the council with these plans, but the Queen mustn't know. We can't have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm. There's too much at stake.",3,2,32
9037,tyrion, m,tyrion," I'm brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne. Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son when she comes of age, ensuring their loyalty and their army, should we need it.",3,2,31
9038,tyrion, m,tyrion," But remember, the Queen mustn't know.",3,2,6
9039,tyrion, m,tyrion, I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off to Theon Greyjoy.,3,2,10
9040,tyrion, m,tyrion, Precisely. Theon's father loathes the Starks and will convince the boy to come to our side. Greyjoy can destroy the Northern army from within and we can have his father's ships.,3,2,31
9041,tyrion, m,tyrion," But remember, you must tell no one.",3,2,7
9042,tyrion, m,tyrion, I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale. Lysa is not fond of me. But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones.,3,2,34
9043,tyrion, m,tyrion," For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don't you think?",3,2,14
9044,tyrion, m,tyrion, Who better?,3,2,2
9045,tyrion, m,tyrion," The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold and Harrenhal.",3,2,28
9046,tyrion, m,tyrion," Never took you for a superstitious man. By all means, tear it down and rebuild. You'll be able to afford it. I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands.",3,2,30
9047,tyrion, m,tyrion, You served my family well in the matter of the succession.,3,2,11
9048,tyrion, m,tyrion," I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn. I didn't need Janos Slynt. It's settled, then?",3,2,15
9049,tyrion, m,tyrion, Good. Oh. And remember,3,2,4
9050,tyrion, m,tyrion, Myrcella's a princess. Some would say she was born for this.,3,2,11
9051,tyrion, m,tyrion, Dorne is the safest place for her.,3,2,7
9052,tyrion, m,tyrion, That's why we need to seduce them. We're going to need their support in the war your son started.,3,2,19
9053,tyrion, m,tyrion, A guest.,3,2,2
9054,tyrion, m,tyrion," It's done, Cersei.",3,2,3
9055,tyrion, m,tyrion,  You cannot stop it.,3,2,4
9056,tyrion, m,tyrion," Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls? Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children? Make no mistake. They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours.",3,2,39
9057,tyrion, m,tyrion," No, afraid not. Sorry about that.",3,2,6
9058,tyrion, m,tyrion," Yes, I fear so. Sorry about that, too.",3,2,8
9059,tyrion, m,tyrion, That's a shame. You were to be the centerpiece of my next deception. My brother Jaime rots in a northern stockade. I would see him released. That's where you come in.,3,2,31
9060,tyrion, m,tyrion," No, he won't. But his mother might. How would you like to see your beloved Cat again?",3,2,17
9061,tyrion, m,tyrion, Find him?,3,2,2
9062,tyrion, m,tyrion," No, you don't.",3,2,3
9063,tyrion, m,tyrion," You disappoint me, Grand Maester.",3,2,5
9064,tyrion, m,tyrion, So loyal that you told the Queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne.,3,2,15
9065,tyrion, m,tyrion," See, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys. I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn. I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish. No one but you.",3,2,41
9066,tyrion, m,tyrion, Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats.,3,2,10
9067,tyrion, m,tyrion," Well, make do.",3,2,3
9068,tyrion, m,tyrion, How long have you been spying for my sister?,3,2,9
9069,tyrion, m,tyrion, I don't like his beard.,3,2,5
9070,tyrion, m,tyrion," How many Hands have you betrayed, Pycelle? Eddard Stark? Jon Arryn?",3,2,11
9071,tyrion, m,tyrion, So you poisoned him?,3,2,4
9072,tyrion, m,tyrion," But you let him die, made sure he succumbed.",3,2,9
9073,tyrion, m,tyrion, Get him out of my sight. Throw him in one of the black cells.,3,2,14
9074,tyrion, m,tyrion, For your trouble.,3,2,3
9075,tyrion, m,tyrion, Good. One of my better ideas.,3,2,6
9076,tyrion, m,tyrion, The Council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly. I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave.,3,2,20
9077,tyrion, m,tyrion," Why, am I about to hear one?",3,2,7
9078,tyrion, m,tyrion, Depends on the sellsword.,3,2,4
9079,tyrion, m,tyrion," He has a sword, the power of life and death.",3,2,10
9080,tyrion, m,tyrion, I've decided I don't like riddles.,3,2,6
9081,tyrion, m,tyrion, You brought this on yourself.,2,2,5
9082,tyrion, m,tyrion, Do you understand we’re losing the war?,2,2,7
9083,tyrion, m,tyrion, It was quite a battle.,2,2,5
9084,tyrion, m,tyrion, (Begins to pour wine). Strange things do happen. You should taste her fish pie.,2,2,14
9085,tyrion, m,tyrion, Men like Lord Varys and I can't let our disadvantages get the best of us. We'll make a fisherman of him yet. (Takes a sip).,2,2,25
9086,tyrion, m,tyrion," Your discretion is legendary, where your friends are concerned.",2,2,9
9087,tyrion, m,tyrion, I don't like threats.,2,2,4
9088,tyrion, m,tyrion, I'm not Ned Stark. I understand the way this game is played.,2,2,12
9089,tyrion, m,tyrion, And I am not. Threaten me again and I will have you thrown into the sea.,2,2,16
9090,tyrion, m,tyrion," You've perfected the art of tearing up papers. Give him his father's bones back, at least, as a gesture of good faith.",2,2,22
9091,tyrion, m,tyrion," Safe travels, cousin.",2,2,3
9092,tyrion, m,tyrion, You have a deft hand with diplomacy.,2,2,7
9093,tyrion, m,tyrion, Lord Commander asks that we send more men to man The Wall.,2,2,12
9094,tyrion, m,tyrion," Cold winds are rising, and the dead rise with them.",2,2,10
9095,tyrion, m,tyrion," According to the Commander, one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers. (The other stop leaving). Mormont doesn't lie.",2,2,21
9096,tyrion, m,tyrion, Apparently you burn him.,2,2,4
9097,tyrion, m,tyrion," I don't know what I believe, but here's a fact for you. The Night's Watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the Wall.",2,2,28
9098,tyrion, m,tyrion," Leave us, Podrick. I believe we know how to pour our own wine.",2,2,13
9099,tyrion, m,tyrion," Myself, I prefer the improper ones.",2,2,6
9100,tyrion, m,tyrion," You know your wines, my lord.",2,2,6
9101,tyrion, m,tyrion," Call me Tyrion, please. I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners, now that you're a lord.",2,2,17
9102,tyrion, m,tyrion,Wars have been started for less.,2,2,6
9103,tyrion, m,tyrion, I heard there was some trouble in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.,2,2,12
9104,tyrion, m,tyrion," Yes, of course. City Watch must keep the peace. Only, I hadn't realized peace depended on killing babies.",2,2,18
9105,tyrion, m,tyrion, Quite right. Especially the queen's orders.,2,2,6
9106,tyrion, m,tyrion," No, but who else would want to murder King Robert's bastards? She's always been a jealous woman.",2,2,17
9107,tyrion, m,tyrion, You've heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister.,2,2,10
9108,tyrion, m,tyrion," That's good of you, but you have heard them. I suppose people who do believe that filth, consider Robert's bastards to be better claimants to the throne than Cersei's children.",2,2,30
9109,tyrion, m,tyrion, I appreciate your loyalty. Tell me.,2,2,6
9110,tyrion, m,tyrion, The fool! He had no idea you were already bought.,2,2,10
9111,tyrion, m,tyrion," I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos. I'm denying its existence.",2,2,11
9112,tyrion, m,tyrion," Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp. And yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless you'd like to take it from my friend here.",2,2,28
9113,tyrion, m,tyrion," I intend to serve as Hand of the King until my father returns from the war, and seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King, well, I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about.",2,2,37
9114,tyrion, m,tyrion, The queen regent. And you're a fool to believe she's your friend.,2,2,12
9115,tyrion, m,tyrion," No, we shan't.",2,2,3
9116,tyrion, m,tyrion," There's a ship leaving for East Watch by the sea tonight. From there, I'm afraid it's rather a long walk to Castle Black. I hope you enjoy the Wall. I found it surprisingly beautiful, in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable sort of way.",2,2,42
9117,tyrion, m,tyrion, His name is Bronn... and he is the new commander of the City Watch.,2,2,14
9118,tyrion, m,tyrion, To the new Commander.,2,2,4
9119,tyrion, m,tyrion," If I told you to murder, an infant girl say, still at her mother's breast, would you do it without question?",2,2,21
9120,tyrion, m,tyrion, I have every right. I am the King's Hand.,2,2,9
9121,tyrion, m,tyrion," Listen to me, Queen Regent, you're losing the people. Do you hear me?",2,2,13
9122,tyrion, m,tyrion," You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead. Half the city will starve when winter comes. The other half will plot to overthrow you. And your gold-plated thugs just gave them the rallying cry, “The Queen slaughters babies.” (Cersei says nothing). You don't even have the decency to deny it.",2,2,55
9123,tyrion, m,tyrion," It wasn't you who gave the order, was it? Joffrey didn't even tell you. Or did he tell you? I imagine that would be even worse.",2,2,26
9124,tyrion, m,tyrion," I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling that that.",2,2,12
9125,tyrion, m,tyrion," (Tries not to laugh). As has Jaime repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon.",2,2,12
9126,tyrion, m,tyrion, She was my mother too.,2,2,5
9127,tyrion, m,tyrion, Beloved nephew.,1,2,2
9128,tyrion, m,tyrion, We looked for you on the battlefield. (Joffrey sits down). You were nowhere to be found.,1,2,16
9129,tyrion, m,tyrion," What a fine job you've done. (Turns to Myrcella). Look at you. (Kisses her). More beautiful than ever. (Turns to Tommen). And you! You, you're going to be bigger than the Hound, but much better looking. (Tyrion smiles. He and Myrcella laugh). This one doesn't like me.",1,2,47
9130,tyrion, m,tyrion," Me, too, dear. Death is so boring, especially now with so much excitement in the world. (Looks at Sansa). My Lady, I'm sorry for your loss.",1,2,26
9131,tyrion, m,tyrion, But still her father. Surely having so recently lost your own beloved father you can sympathize.,1,2,16
9132,tyrion, m,tyrion, Of course you are.,1,2,4
9133,tyrion, m,tyrion," Well, (Gulps down his wine), enjoy your name day, Your Grace. Wish I could stay and celebrate, but there is work to be done.",1,2,24
9134,tyrion, m,tyrion," Don't get up. More ravishing than ever, big sister. (Kisses Cersei on the cheek). War agrees with you. Forgive the interruption, carry on.",1,2,23
9135,tyrion, m,tyrion," (Sits down) It's been a remarkable journey. I, (grabs a glass), pissed off the edge of the Wall, I slept in a sky cell. (Pours himself wine). I fought with the hill tribes. So many adventures, so much to be thankful for.",1,2,42
9136,tyrion, m,tyrion," Yes., well, I, do believe the Hand of the King is welcome at all small council meetings.",1,2,17
9137,tyrion, m,tyrion," Yes, but in his absence…",1,2,5
9138,tyrion, m,tyrion," If I were capable of tricking father, I'd be emperor of the world by now. You brought this on yourself. (Cersei sits down).",1,2,23
9139,tyrion, m,tyrion, Quite right. You did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark's head. Now the entire North has risen up against us.,1,2,22
9140,tyrion, m,tyrion, Did you? You failed. That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation.,1,2,15
9141,tyrion, m,tyrion, Who's won every battle he's fought. Do you understand we're losing the war?,1,2,13
9142,tyrion, m,tyrion, Nothing. But I know people. And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us.,1,2,21
9143,tyrion, m,tyrion, Joffrey is King.,1,2,3
9144,tyrion, m,tyrion," I'm only here to advise him. And if the King listens to what I say, the King might just get his Uncle Jaime back.",1,2,24
9145,tyrion, m,tyrion, You love your children. It's your one redeeming quality. That and your cheekbones. The Starks love their children as well. And we have two of them.,1,2,26
9146,tyrion, m,tyrion, One?,1,2,1
9147,tyrion, m,tyrion," Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade. You chopped one's head off and let another escape. Father will be furious. It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child.",1,2,37
9148,tyrion, m,tyrion," A bit corpsey, yes.",1,2,4
9149,tyrion, m,tyrion, I thought you wanted to come here.,1,2,7
9150,tyrion, m,tyrion, You love the smell of dead bodies and shit?,1,2,9
9151,tyrion, m,tyrion, You can smell cum from the balcony?,1,2,7
9152,tyrion, m,tyrion, And so did the country.,1,2,5
9153,tyrion, m,tyrion," Yes, well, you need to be careful. No one can know you're here.",1,2,13
9154,tyrion, m,tyrion," You can't trust anyone in King's Landing. They're all liars; good liars, bad liars, one or two great liars.",1,2,19
9155,tyrion, m,tyrion, Me? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to the truth.,1,2,11
9156,tyrion, m,tyrion," Why do you think I am so little? I'm being, (Lays down on the bed with Shae), crushed beneath the weight of all that truth.",1,2,25
9157,tyrion, m,tyrion," Ned Stark actually slept on this, as if the poor man didn't suffer enough. One of the many changes we'll have to make around here.",1,2,25
9158,tyrion, m,tyrion, Accounts differ. Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way.,5,2,11
9159,tyrion, m,tyrion," Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour.",5,2,24
9160,tyrion, m,tyrion," It's not what Varys says. He says Renly's army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea.",5,2,26
9161,tyrion, m,tyrion," And I say Father raised you to have too much respect for money. Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later.",5,2,23
9162,tyrion, m,tyrion, She'll be safer in Dorne.,5,2,5
9163,tyrion, m,tyrion," It so happens that I am. Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl and I don't blame her at all for you.",5,2,21
9164,tyrion, m,tyrion, Schemes and plots are the same thing. They are going to attack us. We need to be ready.,5,2,18
9165,tyrion, m,tyrion, May I ask specifically what the king has in mind?,5,2,10
9166,tyrion, m,tyrion, It's important that we talk about this.,5,2,7
9167,tyrion, m,tyrion," Wildfire? You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?",5,2,9
9168,tyrion, m,tyrion,That's a lie right there.,5,2,5
9169,tyrion, m,tyrion," Tell me, if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely? When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean.",5,2,37
9170,tyrion, m,tyrion, The smart money would be on more likely.,5,2,8
9171,tyrion, m,tyrion, But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours.,5,2,13
9172,tyrion, m,tyrion, I suppose there's only one way to find out.,5,2,9
9173,tyrion, m,tyrion, When did she tell you this?,5,2,6
9174,tyrion, m,tyrion, Swear to me on what?,5,2,5
9175,tyrion, m,tyrion, But I don't care about your life.,5,2,7
9176,tyrion, m,tyrion," All right, all right. Enough. Even torturing you is boring. Just get out.",5,2,13
9177,tyrion, m,tyrion," Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me.",5,2,16
9178,tyrion, m,tyrion," Stannis has more infantry, more ships, more horses. What do we have?",5,2,12
9179,tyrion, m,tyrion," Well, I've never actually been able to kill people with it.",5,2,11
9180,tyrion, m,tyrion," He hasn't sent a raven in weeks. He's very busy. Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is time-consuming. We won't be able to hold the city against Stannis, not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it.",5,2,36
9181,tyrion, m,tyrion, It's hard to argue with his assessment.,5,2,7
9182,tyrion, m,tyrion, The king is a lost cause. It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.,5,2,15
9183,tyrion, m,tyrion, You have to admire his imagination.,5,2,6
9184,tyrion, m,tyrion, What? Demon monkey?,5,2,3
9185,tyrion, m,tyrion, Blame me? I'm trying to save them.,5,2,7
9186,tyrion, m,tyrion, Demon monkey.,5,2,2
9187,tyrion, m,tyrion," I remember reading an old sailors' proverb, ""Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off. """,5,2,16
9188,tyrion, m,tyrion, My companion takes issue.,5,2,4
9189,tyrion, m,tyrion, How much do you have?,5,2,5
9190,tyrion, m,tyrion, My friend remains unconvinced.,5,2,4
9191,tyrion, m,tyrion," I'm afraid I have to concur with my advisor, Wisdom Haylene. The contents of this room could lay King's Landing low. You won't be making wildfire for my sister any longer. You'll be making it for me.",5,2,37
9192,tyrion, m,tyrion, What is the meaning of this?,4,2,6
9193,tyrion, m,tyrion, What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?,4,2,8
9194,tyrion, m,tyrion, Someone get the girl something to cover herself with. She is to be your queen. Have you no regard for her honor?,4,2,22
9195,tyrion, m,tyrion," For what crimes? She did not fight her brother's battle, you half-wit.",4,2,12
9196,tyrion, m,tyrion, The Mad King did as he liked. Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him?,4,2,18
9197,tyrion, m,tyrion," I'm not threatening the king, ser. I am educating my nephew. Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him. That was a threat. See the difference?",4,2,27
9198,tyrion, m,tyrion, I apologize for my nephew's behavior. Tell me the truth. Do you want an end to this engagement?,4,2,18
9199,tyrion, m,tyrion," Lady Stark, you may survive us yet.",4,2,7
9200,tyrion, m,tyrion, You think dipping his wick will cure what ails him?,4,2,10
9201,tyrion, m,tyrion," Your visits are too few, cousin.",4,2,6
9202,tyrion, m,tyrion,  So it is. Will you take a cup with me? I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.,4,2,18
9203,tyrion, m,tyrion," If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle, I would have thought she'd come herself.",4,2,15
9204,tyrion, m,tyrion, And you've received these instructions directly from Cersei?,4,2,8
9205,tyrion, m,tyrion, And you've waited this long to deliver the information?,4,2,9
9206,tyrion, m,tyrion," Cersei must have great trust in you, allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf.",4,2,18
9207,tyrion, m,tyrion, She must be very glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn.,4,2,14
9208,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Ah. Lavender oil. She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl.",4,2,12
9209,tyrion, m,tyrion," An anointed knight, yes. Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed? What? Nothing to say? No more warnings for me, ser?",4,2,30
9210,tyrion, m,tyrion, Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out you've been bedding his mother?,4,2,23
9211,tyrion, m,tyrion," Did she take you against your will? Can you not defend yourself, knight?",4,2,13
9212,tyrion, m,tyrion," Did he tell you to fuck her, too?",4,2,8
9213,tyrion, m,tyrion," Hated every moment of it, is that what you'll have me believe? A high place in court, a knighthood, my sister's legs spreading open for you at night. Oh, yes, it must have been terrible. Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this.",4,2,44
9214,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Save it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel.,4,2,9
9215,tyrion, m,tyrion," No, I think not.",4,2,4
9216,tyrion, m,tyrion," You heard me. My father told you to obey my sister. Obey her. Stay close to her side. Keep her trust. Pleasure her whenever she requires. No one ever need know, as long as you keep faith with me. I want to know what Cersei is doing, where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, everything. And you will tell me.",4,2,63
9217,tyrion, m,tyrion," Oh, rise, rise. Let us drink to our understanding. Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well. Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman, and it's all for the good of the realm. Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness, that I want no more conflict between us and that, henceforth, I shall do nothing without her consent.",4,2,62
9218,tyrion, m,tyrion," Oh, I'll give her Pycelle.",4,2,5
9219,tyrion, m,tyrion," Yes, I'll release him in the morning. Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants, but I will not have him on the Council. I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true. Stay within one table length.",4,2,53
9220,tyrion, m,tyrion, Get the Prince back to the Keep now.,6,2,8
9221,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Move. Move!,6,2,2
9222,tyrion, m,tyrion, Where's Sansa?,6,2,2
9223,tyrion, m,tyrion," You blind, bloody fool.",6,2,4
9224,tyrion, m,tyrion," We've had vicious kings and we've had idiot kings, but I don't know if we've ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king.",6,2,25
9225,tyrion, m,tyrion," I can, I am.",6,2,4
9226,tyrion, m,tyrion," They threw a cow pie at you, so you decided to kill them all? They're starving, you fool. All because of a war you started.",6,2,25
9227,tyrion, m,tyrion, And now I've struck a king. Did my hand fall from my wrist? Where is the Stark girl?,6,2,18
9228,tyrion, m,tyrion," If she dies, you'll never get your Uncle Jaime back. You owe him quite a bit, you know.",6,2,18
9229,tyrion, m,tyrion, Take some men and go and find the Stark girl.,6,2,10
9230,tyrion, m,tyrion," Are you hurt, my lady?",6,2,5
9231,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Well done, Clegane.",6,2,3
9232,tyrion, m,tyrion, Since when do you light your own candles?,7,2,8
9233,tyrion, m,tyrion," Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted sailing north past Tarth, 200 ships.",7,2,12
9234,tyrion, m,tyrion," Yes, that's more than we have. He'll be at our gates within five days, four if he has the wind.",7,2,20
9235,tyrion, m,tyrion," ""Rain fire on them from above."" You're quoting Father, aren't you?",7,2,11
9236,tyrion, m,tyrion," Call it tactics, not strategy. But, yes, he does have a good mind for it. The best mind, some would say. Sadly, he's not here. It's just you, me and Joffrey, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.",7,2,42
9237,tyrion, m,tyrion, He needs to start acting like a king. This war you started is coming to our doorstep. And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead,7,2,25
9238,tyrion, m,tyrion, I thought the girls might help him.,7,2,7
9239,tyrion, m,tyrion, I was wrong. If we can't control him,7,2,8
9240,tyrion, m,tyrion, It's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head.,7,2,17
9241,tyrion, m,tyrion, The boy is more Robert than Jaime.,7,2,7
9242,tyrion, m,tyrion, Sins?,7,2,1
9243,tyrion, m,tyrion," You've beaten the odds. Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them.",7,2,14
9244,tyrion, m,tyrion,  The bastard of Winterfell.,3,7,4
9245,tyrion, m,tyrion,  I believe we last saw each other on top of the wall.,3,7,12
9246,tyrion, m,tyrion,  It's been a long road.  But we're both still here.,3,7,10
9247,tyrion, m,tyrion,  I'm Tyrion Lannister.,3,7,3
9248,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Ah, the Onion Knight.  We fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Blackwater Bay.",3,7,15
9249,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Missandei is the queen's most trusted advisor.,3,7,7
9250,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  And Sansa, I hear she's alive and well.",3,7,8
9251,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Does she miss me terribly?,3,7,5
9252,tyrion, m,tyrion,  A sham marriage and unconsummated.,3,7,5
9253,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Well, it was.  It wasn't.  Anyway, she's much smarter than she lets on.",3,7,13
9254,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Good.  At some point I want to hear how a Knight's Watch recruit became King in the North.,3,7,18
9255,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  A long and bloody tale.  To be honest, I was drunk for most of it.",3,7,15
9256,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Of course they do.  If I was your hand I would have advised against it.  General rule of thumb, Stark men don't fare well when they travel south.",3,7,28
9257,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  I'd say you get used to them, but you never really do.",3,7,12
9258,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Come.  Their mother is waiting for you.,3,7,7
9259,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth.",3,7,7
9260,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Forever.,3,7,1
9261,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Almost.,3,7,1
9262,tyrion, m,tyrion,  I do.,3,7,2
9263,tyrion, m,tyrion,  I believe he's calling all of us children.  Figure of speech.,3,7,11
9264,tyrion, m,tyrion,  The Army of the Dead?,3,7,5
9265,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  No, I don't think you're either of those things.",3,7,9
9266,tyrion, m,tyrion,  The war against my sister has already begun.  You can't expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting --,3,7,21
9267,tyrion, m,tyrion,  If it doesn't matter you might as well kneel.,3,7,9
9268,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys.  Help her to defeat my sister and together our armies will protect the north.,3,7,20
9269,tyrion, m,tyrion,  It takes no time to bend the knee.  Pledge your sword to her cause.,3,7,14
9270,tyrion, m,tyrion,  I came out here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack.  You're making it difficult.  You look a lot better brooding than I do.  You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.,3,7,38
9271,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island.  You're free to walk the castle, the beaches, to go wherever you want.",3,7,22
9272,tyrion, m,tyrion,  I wouldn't say we took your ship.,3,7,7
9273,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Why don't you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies, and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men.",3,7,27
9274,tyrion, m,tyrion,  I do actually.,3,7,3
9275,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  It was all nonsense.  Everybody knew it.  But then Mormont saw them and you saw them, and I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows.",3,7,32
9276,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Good question.,3,7,2
9277,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  People's minds aren't made for problems that large.  White Walkers, the Night King, Army of the Dead, it's almost a relief to confront a familiar monster like my sister.",3,7,29
9278,tyrion, m,tyrion,  It seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily.,3,7,15
9279,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Children are not their fathers, luckily for all of us.  And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye.  Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago but she didn't.  Instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now.  While you're our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad King's daughter.  She protects people from monsters, just as you do.  That's why she came here.  And she's not about to head north to fight an enemy she's never seen on a word of a man she doesn't know after a single meeting.  That's not a reasonable thing to ask.",3,7,125
9280,tyrion, m,tyrion,  So do you have anything reasonable to ask?,3,7,8
9281,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Maybe you are a northern fool.  I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.,3,7,17
9282,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Yes.  Volcanic glass, obsidian.  He says you have a tremendous amount of it here.",3,7,14
9283,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally.",3,7,12
9284,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill White Walkers and their foot soldiers, or stop them, destroy them.  I'm unsure of the nomenclature.",3,7,25
9285,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong, but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it.",3,7,31
9286,tyrion, m,tyrion,  I don't remember.,3,7,3
9287,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  I would never do that...to you.  The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here.  All of his advisors would have told him not to come.  I would have told him not to come, yet he's here anyway.  You don't have to believe him.  Let him mine the Dragonglass.  If he's wrong it's worthless.  You didn't even know it was here.  It's nothing to you.  Give him something by giving him nothing.  Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally.  Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand.  Casterly Rock.",3,7,98
9288,tyrion, m,tyrion,  You must allow them their flights of fancy.  It's dreary in the north.,3,7,13
9289,tyrion, m,tyrion,  But you'll have to go yourself.  Euron's ships could be anywhere or in more than one place.  You'd be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long.,3,7,30
9290,tyrion, m,tyrion,  It's too great a risk.  You're too important.,3,7,8
9291,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Yes.  Cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy House Lannister.  She will be ready.,3,7,17
9292,tyrion, m,tyrion,  No one has ever taken the rock.,3,7,7
9293,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  The Lannister army is still the army my father built.  Well trained and well provisioned.  10,000 men at least.  They will see us coming.",3,7,24
9294,tyrion, m,tyrion,  They will be ready.,3,7,4
9295,tyrion, m,tyrion,  The gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable.,3,7,7
9296,tyrion, m,tyrion,  The fight up the walls will be hard.  We'll be at a disadvantage.  Many men will die.,3,7,17
9297,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Interesting thing about my father.  He built our house up from near ruin.  He built our army.  He built Casterly Rock as we know it, but he didn't build the sewers.  That was beneath him.  So he gave the job to the lowest person he could find.  Me.  He was right.  I was low.  The company I kept low, women mostly.  They weren't welcome at the Rock.  Father disapproved of that sort of behavior.  I couldn't walk them through the front gates.  I couldn't have them in my chambers.  So in the process of building the sewers I threw in something for myself.",3,7,103
9298,tyrion, m,tyrion,  It was a passage that began by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers.,3,7,18
9299,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  No better place for low pursuits.  Casterly Rock, the impregnable fortress.",3,7,11
9300,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  As a good friend of mine once said, ""give me 10 good men and I'll impregnate the bitch.""",3,7,18
9301,tyrion, m,tyrion,  And so it begins.  They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces.  They will be outnumbered.  They will have less armor and fewer weapons.,3,7,25
9302,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  But as my sister's armies fights for her, the Unsullied will be fighting for something greater.  They will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them.  They will be fighting for you.  And that is why they will triump.",3,7,43
9303,tyrion, m,tyrion," On a night like this, you came into the world.",2,7,10
9304,tyrion, m,tyrion, We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.,2,7,7
9305,tyrion, m,tyrion, Conquering Westeros would be easy for you. But you're not here to be queen of the ashes.,2,7,17
9306,tyrion, m,tyrion," We can take the Seven Kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse. If the great houses support your claim against Cersei, the game is won. With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side, we have powerful allies in the south.",2,7,42
9307,tyrion, m,tyrion," Your Grace, when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin, Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who--",2,7,24
9308,tyrion, m,tyrion, Lord Varys has proven himself a loyal servant.,2,7,8
9309,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it?",2,7,8
9310,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Jon Snow?  Ned Stark's bastard?,2,7,5
9311,tyrion, m,tyrion,  I traveled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night's Watch.,2,7,13
9312,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  I can't speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him, and I am an excellent judge of character.",2,7,27
9313,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  If he does rule the north, he would make a valuable ally.  The Lannisters executed his father and conspired to murder his brother.  Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do.",2,7,35
9314,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms.",2,7,14
9315,tyrion, m,tyrion,    I know how you wage war.  We don't poison little girls here.  Myrcella was innocent.,2,7,15
9316,tyrion, m,tyrion,  But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.,2,7,7
9317,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Cersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros by appealing to their loyalty, their love for their country.  If we besiege the city with foreigners, we prove her point.  Our army should be Westerosi.",2,7,35
9318,tyrion, m,tyrion,  You are.,2,7,2
9319,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear and her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army back up to King's Landing.,2,7,22
9320,tyrion, m,tyrion,  The Dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the Tyrell army.  Two great kingdoms united against Cersei.,2,7,18
9321,tyrion, m,tyrion,  The unsullied will have another objective.  For decades House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros.  And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock.  Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock and take it.,2,7,39
9322,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  My sister, she wasn't your queen until recently though, was she, until she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed House Tyrell for all time.  So it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible.",5,7,32
9323,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Perhaps he could take the black, Your Grace.  Whatever else he is, he is a true soldier.  He would be invaluable at the Wall.",5,7,24
9324,tyrion, m,tyrion,  You are the future of your house.  This war has already wiped one great house from the world.  Don't let it happen again.  Bend the knee.,5,7,26
9325,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Your Grace, nothing strips bold notions from a man's head like a few weeks in a dark cell.",5,7,18
9326,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Your Grace, if you begin beheading entire families --",5,7,9
9327,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Your Grace --,5,7,3
9328,tyrion, m,tyrion,  All rulers demand that people bend the knee.  It's why they're rulers.  She gave Tarley a choice.  A man who had taken up arms against her.  What else could she do?,5,7,31
9329,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  I am her hand, not her head.  I can't make her decisions for her.",5,7,14
9330,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Daenerys is not her father.,5,7,5
9331,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Who is that for?,5,7,4
9332,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Did you read it?,5,7,4
9333,tyrion, m,tyrion,  What's it say?,5,7,3
9334,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Perhaps not.  Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children.  What if we prove her wrong?,5,7,28
9335,tyrion, m,tyrion,  So bring the dead to her.,5,7,6
9336,tyrion, m,tyrion,  We don't have to bring the whole army.  Only one soldier.,5,7,11
9337,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Bring one of these things down to King's Landing and show her the truth.,5,7,14
9338,tyrion, m,tyrion,  The only person she listens to is Jaime.  He may listen to me.,5,7,13
9339,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Last time I was here I killed my father with a crossbow.,5,7,12
9340,tyrion, m,tyrion,  You're not staying here?,5,7,4
9341,tyrion, m,tyrion,  What if someone takes the boat?,5,7,6
9342,tyrion, m,tyrion,  I needed to see you and I knew you'd never agree to meet.,5,7,13
9343,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  You made me look like a complete fool.  I thought I'd surprise you by hitting Casterly Rock, but you were three steps ahead of me.  You abandoned the family home.  Completely unsentimental.  Father would have been proud.",5,7,37
9344,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Listen to me --,5,7,4
9345,tyrion, m,tyrion,  It would take you awhile with a sparring sword.,5,7,9
9346,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  He was going to execute me.  He knew I was innocent.  He didn't hate me because of anything I did, he hated me because of what I am.  The little monster sent to punish him.  Do you think I wanted to be born this way?  Did he think I chose --",5,7,51
9347,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Daenerys will win this war.  You're a military man.  You must know there is no way around it.  Daenerys is not her father.  She's even willing to suspend hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.,5,7,35
9348,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Fish hook.  Some men you just can't teach.,5,7,8
9349,tyrion, m,tyrion,  He'll do.,5,7,2
9350,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  You may not believe it, but I've missed you Mormont.  Nobody glowers quite like you.  Not even Grey Worm.",5,7,19
9351,tyrion, m,tyrion,  This is the coin the slaver gave me when I suggested he free us and pay us.  Remember?,5,7,18
9352,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Take it with you.  You'll bring it back.  Our queen needs you.,5,7,12
9353,tyrion, m,tyrion,  We took Casterly Rock.,4,7,4
9354,tyrion, m,tyrion,  We still have the largest army.,4,7,6
9355,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back.  We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland.  Commit to the blockade of King's Landing.  We have a plan.  It's still the right plan.,4,7,35
9356,tyrion, m,tyrion,  If I've underestimated our enemies --,4,7,6
9357,tyrion, m,tyrion,  We've discussed this.,4,7,3
9358,tyrion, m,tyrion,  A smart one.,4,7,3
9359,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Flee, you idiot!",4,7,3
9360,tyrion, m,tyrion,  You fucking idiot.,4,7,3
9361,tyrion, m,tyrion,  I honestly don't.,6,7,3
9362,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Oh.  I've been heroic on occasion.,6,7,6
9363,tyrion, m,tyrion,  I once charged through the mud gate of King's Landing.,6,7,10
9364,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  It's interesting these heroes you name.  Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all fell in love with you.",6,7,20
9365,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Oh, my mistake.  I suppose he stares at you longingly because he's hopeful for a successful military alliance.",6,7,18
9366,tyrion, m,tyrion," A million, give or take.",7,7,5
9367,tyrion, m,tyrion, There's more work in the city. And the brothels are far superior.,7,7,12
9368,tyrion, m,tyrion," I imagine it was a sad joke at the end. An entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs. But in the beginning, when it was home to Balerion the Dread, it must have been the most dangerous place in the world.",7,7,44
9369,tyrion, m,tyrion, A pleasant surprise in an unpleasant situation.,7,7,7
9370,tyrion, m,tyrion," Supporting the enemy, no less.",7,7,5
9371,tyrion, m,tyrion, Cersei will anyway.,7,7,3
9372,tyrion, m,tyrion, (Shakes his head.),7,7,3
9373,tyrion, m,tyrion, Here we are the heroes of Blackwater Bay. Strange place for a reunion.,7,7,13
9374,tyrion, m,tyrion," I don't think I'm anyone's lord anymore, Podrick. Save the titles for Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.",7,7,17
9375,tyrion, m,tyrion, You've been thinking about our new queen.,7,7,7
9376,tyrion, m,tyrion," Are you? Helping me to arrange this meeting wasn't exactly looking after yourself, was it? You put yourself at risk.",7,7,20
9377,tyrion, m,tyrion, It's good to see you again.,7,7,6
9378,tyrion, m,tyrion, You might.,7,7,2
9379,tyrion, m,tyrion, And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through.,7,7,10
9380,tyrion, m,tyrion, She'll be here soon.,7,7,4
9381,tyrion, m,tyrion, No.,7,7,1
9382,tyrion, m,tyrion, We are all facing a unique,7,7,6
9383,tyrion, m,tyrion, I think we ought to begin with larger concerns.,7,7,9
9384,tyrion, m,tyrion, Do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes? His wasn't even good. He explained it at the end. Never explain. It always ruins it.,7,7,24
9385,tyrion, m,tyrion," We are a group of people who do not like one another, as this recent demonstration has shown. We have suffered at each other's hands. We have lost people we love at each other's hands. If all we wanted was more of the same, there would be no need for this gathering. We are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting face-to-face.",7,7,65
9386,tyrion, m,tyrion, We all know that will never happen.,7,7,7
9387,tyrion, m,tyrion, There is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years. We have something to show you.,7,7,17
9388,tyrion, m,tyrion, I'm pleased you bent the knee to our queen,7,7,9
9389,tyrion, m,tyrion, That is indeed a problem. The more immediate problem is that we're fucked.,7,7,13
9390,tyrion, m,tyrion," Only one. Everyone stays here, and I go and talk to my sister.",7,7,13
9391,tyrion, m,tyrion, I don't want Cersei to murder me either. I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble.,7,7,22
9392,tyrion, m,tyrion,  She'll definitely murder you. I go see my sister.,7,7,9
9393,tyrion, m,tyrion, You spoke with her?,7,7,4
9394,tyrion, m,tyrion," I'm about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world who's already tried to kill me twice, that I know of. Who's an idiot?",7,7,29
9395,tyrion, m,tyrion," A foreign whore you can't abduct, beat, or intimidate. That must be difficult for you.",7,7,15
9396,tyrion, m,tyrion,  I didn't know about that.,7,7,5
9397,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Cersei, I didn't know.",7,7,4
9398,tyrion, m,tyrion, I am the one preventing that from happening. Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate. She didn't want to bring you words. She wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise. I don't want to destroy our family. I never have.,7,7,45
9399,tyrion, m,tyrion," After he sentenced me to death for a crime I didn't commit, yes, I killed him. Hate me for it if you want. I hate myself for it in spite of what he was, in spite of what he did to me.",7,7,42
9400,tyrion, m,tyrion,  I have never been more sorry about anything.,7,7,8
9401,tyrion, m,tyrion, (starts),7,7,1
9402,tyrion, m,tyrion," All right. You love your family, and I have destroyed it. I will always be a threat. So put an end to me.",7,7,23
9403,tyrion, m,tyrion," If it weren't for me, you'd have a motherIf it weren't for me, you'd have a father.",7,7,17
9404,tyrion, m,tyrion, I am more sorry about the children than you could ever know.,7,7,12
9405,tyrion, m,tyrion,  I don't care. I loved them. You know I did. You know it in your heart if there's anything left of it.,7,7,22
9406,tyrion, m,tyrion," If there's no future, then why are we here? Why did you allow me to come?",7,7,16
9407,tyrion, m,tyrion," Yes, no, not what you hoped for, but you must have hoped for something.",7,7,14
9408,tyrion, m,tyrion," Mm, not like this.",7,7,4
9409,tyrion, m,tyrion, Yes.,7,7,1
9410,tyrion, m,tyrion, Because I think she will make the world a better place.,7,7,11
9411,tyrion, m,tyrion, She knows herself. She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them.,7,7,17
9412,tyrion, m,tyrion, You're pregnant.,7,7,2
9413,tyrion, m,tyrion," Your Grace, I know my brother-",2,8,6
9414,tyrion, m,tyrion," He came here alone, knowing full well how he'd be received. Why would he do that if he weren't telling the truth?",2,8,22
9415,tyrion, m,tyrion, I was a fool.,2,8,4
9416,tyrion, m,tyrion, I suspect one of you will be wearing this before it's all over.,2,8,13
9417,tyrion, m,tyrion," Well, here we are.",2,8,4
9418,tyrion, m,tyrion, Together again.,2,8,2
9419,tyrion, m,tyrion, And the masses rejoice.,2,8,4
9420,tyrion, m,tyrion, She's your new queen too.,2,8,5
9421,tyrion, m,tyrion, They remember what happened the last time Targaryens brought dragons north. They'll come around once they see Daenerys is different.,2,8,20
9422,tyrion, m,tyrion, She is.,2,8,2
9423,tyrion, m,tyrion, I am.,2,8,2
9424,tyrion, m,tyrion, It's hard to blame her. I made a mistake common to clever people. I underestimated my opponents.,2,8,17
9425,tyrion, m,tyrion, Cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her. A chance for you both to start again. And I believed her.,2,8,20
9426,tyrion, m,tyrion, Was she lying about the baby too?,2,8,7
9427,tyrion, m,tyrion," She never fooled you. You always knew exactly what she was, and you loved her anyway.",2,8,16
9428,tyrion, m,tyrion," So we're going to die at Winterfell. Not the death I would've chosen. I always pictured myself dying in my own bed, the age of 80, with a belly full of wine and-",2,8,33
9429,tyrion, m,tyrion, My cock.,2,8,2
9430,tyrion, m,tyrion, At least Cersei won't get to murder me. I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction denying her that pleasure while I'm being ripped apart by dead men.,2,8,26
9431,tyrion, m,tyrion, Maybe after I'm dead I'll march down to King's Landing and rip her apart.,2,8,14
9432,tyrion, m,tyrion, How will he find you?,2,8,5
9433,tyrion, m,tyrion," When the time comes, Ser Davos and I will be on the walls, to give you the signal to light the trench.",2,8,22
9434,tyrion, m,tyrion," Your Grace, I have fought before, I can do it again. Alongside the men and women risking their lives.",2,8,19
9435,tyrion, m,tyrion, Do you need help?,2,8,4
9436,tyrion, m,tyrion, You've had a strange journey.,2,8,5
9437,tyrion, m,tyrion, I'd like to hear about it.,2,8,6
9438,tyrion, m,tyrion," If only we were trapped in a castle in the middle of winter, with nowhere to go.",2,8,17
9439,tyrion, m,tyrion, I wish Father were here.,2,8,5
9440,tyrion, m,tyrion, I would love to see the look on his face when he realizes his two sons are about to die defending Winterfell.,2,8,22
9441,tyrion, m,tyrion," I remember the first time we were here, the first time I saw this hall.",2,8,15
9442,tyrion, m,tyrion, You were a golden lion. I was a drunken whore-monger. It was all so simple.,2,8,15
9443,tyrion, m,tyrion, I was speaking in relative terms.,2,8,6
9444,tyrion, m,tyrion, Of course I miss it.,2,8,5
9445,tyrion, m,tyrion, It's not. Things would be easier if it were.,2,8,9
9446,tyrion, m,tyrion, The perils of self-betterment.,2,8,4
9447,tyrion, m,tyrion, To contemplate your imminent death. You've come to the right place. You want some of this piss? It's not bad. It's not good either.,2,8,24
9448,tyrion, m,tyrion, And you?,2,8,2
9449,tyrion, m,tyrion," Ser Davos, join us.",2,8,4
9450,tyrion, m,tyrion, Would you like a drink?,2,8,5
9451,tyrion, m,tyrion," It's strange, isn't it? Almost everyone here's fought the Starks at one time or another. And here we are in their castle, ready to defend it. Together.",2,8,27
9452,tyrion, m,tyrion, I think we might live.,2,8,5
9453,tyrion, m,tyrion, I-I do. How many battles have we survived between us? Ser Davos Seaworth. Survivor of both the Blackwater and the Battle of the Bastards.,2,8,24
9454,tyrion, m,tyrion," Mm. Ser Jaime Lannister, fabled hero of the Siege of Pyke.",2,8,11
9455,tyrion, m,tyrion," Hear, hear! Ser Brienne of Tarth. Defeated the Hound in-Pardon me, Lady Brienne.",2,8,13
9456,tyrion, m,tyrion, Ser Brienne of Tarth! Knight of the Seven Kingdoms!,2,8,9
9457,tyrion, m,tyrion," No, let's stay a bit longer.",2,8,6
9458,tyrion, m,tyrion, How about a song? One of you must know one. Ser Davos?,2,8,12
9459,tyrion, m,tyrion, Ser Brienne?,2,8,2
9460,tyrion, m,tyrion, Mmm.,2,8,1
9461,tyrion, m,tyrion, You should consider yourself lucky. At least your balls won’t freeze off.,1,8,12
9462,tyrion, m,tyrion," Because I have balls, and you don't.",1,8,7
9463,tyrion, m,tyrion," If anyone survives the war to come, we'll have Jon Snow to thank. He risked his life to show us the threat is real. Thanks to his courage, we have brought with us the greatest army the world has ever seen. We have brought two full-grown dragons. And soon, the Lannister army will ride north to join our cause.",1,8,59
9464,tyrion, m,tyrion," I know, I know, our people haven't been friends in the past. But we must fight together now or die.",1,8,20
9465,tyrion, m,tyrion, My lord. My lady.,1,8,4
9466,tyrion, m,tyrion, The Lady of Winterfell. Has a nice ring to it.,1,8,10
9467,tyrion, m,tyrion, Last time we spoke was at Joffrey's wedding. Miserable affair.,1,8,10
9468,tyrion, m,tyrion," Yes, it was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the king's murder.",1,8,17
9469,tyrion, m,tyrion, Many underestimated you. Most of them are dead now.,1,8,9
9470,tyrion, m,tyrion," I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear the Lannister army's marching north. You have every right to be fearful of my sister. No one fears her more than I do. But I promise, you'll be safe-",1,8,36
9471,tyrion, m,tyrion, She did.,1,8,2
9472,tyrion, m,tyrion, She has something to live for now. I believe she wants to survive.,1,8,13
9473,tyrion, m,tyrion," One of the better sigils. Beats an onion, anyway.",1,8,9
9474,tyrion, m,tyrion, And our queen is grateful.,1,8,5
9475,tyrion, m,tyrion, I sense that you're leading to a proposal.,1,8,8
9476,tyrion, m,tyrion, They do make a handsome couple.,1,8,6
9477,tyrion, m,tyrion, I'm not that old.,1,8,4
9478,tyrion, m,tyrion, Not as old as him.,1,8,5
9479,tyrion, m,tyrion, Our queen respects the wisdom of age.,1,8,7
9480,tyrion, m,tyrion, What is that?,1,8,3
9481,tyrion, m,tyrion, And a Lord of Storm's End who will be forever loyal to you.,4,8,13
9482,tyrion, m,tyrion,  I'm sure you had your reasons.,4,8,6
9483,tyrion, m,tyrion,   So did you?,4,8,3
9484,tyrion, m,tyrion,  I don't imagine thinking about that subject will leave you any happier than before.,4,8,14
9485,tyrion, m,tyrion," Then you're in luck. We may have defeated them, but we still have us to contend with.",4,8,17
9486,tyrion, m,tyrion, This is clever. Even better than the saddle I designed for you.,4,8,12
9487,tyrion, m,tyrion, You know our history better than anyone. That will be useful as Lord of Winterfell.,4,8,15
9488,tyrion, m,tyrion, You're the only surviving trueborn son of Ned Stark.,4,8,9
9489,tyrion, m,tyrion, You don't want it.,4,8,4
9490,tyrion, m,tyrion, I envy you.,4,8,3
9491,tyrion, m,tyrion, (drunkenly) Your turn.,4,8,3
9492,tyrion, m,tyrion, Drink.,4,8,1
9493,tyrion, m,tyrion, Go again.,4,8,2
9494,tyrion, m,tyrion, Because it's my game.,4,8,4
9495,tyrion, m,tyrion, Drink.,4,8,1
9496,tyrion, m,tyrion, Drink.,4,8,1
9497,tyrion, m,tyrion, Mm!,4,8,1
9498,tyrion, m,tyrion, No!,4,8,1
9499,tyrion, m,tyrion, You're a virgin.,4,8,3
9500,tyrion, m,tyrion," At no point in the past, up until this very moment, have you slept with a man. Or a woman.",4,8,20
9501,tyrion, m,tyrion, The objective here is to remove Cersei without destroying King's Landing.,4,8,11
9502,tyrion, m,tyrion," I watched the people of King's Landing rebel against their king when they were hungry, and that was before winter began. Give them the opportunity and they will cast Cersei aside.",4,8,31
9503,tyrion, m,tyrion," Once the people see that Cersei is our only enemy, her reign is over.",4,8,14
9504,tyrion, m,tyrion, So if all are in agreement Jon and Ser Davos will ride down the Kingsroad with the Northern troops and the bulk of the remaining Dothraki and Unsullied.,4,8,28
9505,tyrion, m,tyrion," A smaller group of us will ride to White Harbor, and sail from there to Dragonstone with our queen and her dragons accompanying us from above.",4,8,26
9506,tyrion, m,tyrion," Ser Jaime has chosen to remain here, as a guest of the Lady of Winterfell.",4,8,15
9507,tyrion, m,tyrion, So she's going to stay here with you?,4,8,8
9508,tyrion, m,tyrion, I'm happy. I'm happy that you're happy. I'm happy that you'll finally have to climb for it.,4,8,17
9509,tyrion, m,tyrion, Do you know how long I've waited to tell tall-person jokes? To climbing mountains.,4,8,14
9510,tyrion, m,tyrion, What's she like down there?,4,8,5
9511,tyrion, m,tyrion, I haven't been with a woman for years. Give me a morsel.,4,8,12
9512,tyrion, m,tyrion," I am the Imp, and I demand to know.",4,8,9
9513,tyrion, m,tyrion, You're supposed to be south.,4,8,5
9514,tyrion, m,tyrion, That's a bit rude.,4,8,4
9515,tyrion, m,tyrion," You're a knight, thanks to me.",4,8,6
9516,tyrion, m,tyrion, I'm just trying--,4,8,3
9517,tyrion, m,tyrion," See, I don't believe you'd do that, after all--",4,8,9
9518,tyrion, m,tyrion, You broke my nose!,4,8,4
9519,tyrion, m,tyrion, How do you know?,4,8,4
9520,tyrion, m,tyrion, May I speak?,4,8,3
9521,tyrion, m,tyrion, We made a deal long ago. Do you remember?,4,8,9
9522,tyrion, m,tyrion, Highgarden. You could be Lord of the Reach.,4,8,8
9523,tyrion, m,tyrion, It's better than being dead.,4,8,5
9524,tyrion, m,tyrion," You have my word. None of this means a thing until we take King's Landing. We ride south in the morning. We could use an officer with knowledge of the city's defenses.  BRONN; (chuckles)  Oh, no. No, my fighting days are done. But I still got a few killing days left, you hear me? I'll come find you when the war is done. Till then, don't die.",4,8,67
9525,tyrion, m,tyrion,  My lady.,4,8,2
9526,tyrion, m,tyrion," ""My lord"" is the standard response.",4,8,6
9527,tyrion, m,tyrion, You know she loves your brother.,4,8,6
9528,tyrion, m,tyrion," You seem determined to dislike her. A good relationship between the Iron Throne and the North has been the core of every peaceful, prosperous reign we've ever known.",4,8,28
9529,tyrion, m,tyrion, I don't expect him to spend much time here going forward.,4,8,11
9530,tyrion, m,tyrion," Sansa, look at me.",4,8,4
9531,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  With Jon in the capital, you'll be the true power in the North. I'd feel much better about the future if I left here today believing that you and Daenerys were allies.",4,8,32
9532,tyrion, m,tyrion, She's your queen too.,4,8,4
9533,tyrion, m,tyrion, Every good ruler needs to inspire a bit of fear.,4,8,10
9534,tyrion, m,tyrion," No, but as your brother once told me, he's not a Stark.",4,8,12
9535,tyrion, m,tyrion, Are you all right?,4,8,4
9536,tyrion, m,tyrion," Her people love her, you've seen that. You've seen how they fight for her. She wants to make the world a better place. I believe in her.",4,8,27
9537,tyrion, m,tyrion," Think of the past 20 years. The war, the murder, the misery. All of it because Robert Baratheon loved someone who didn't love him back.",4,8,25
9538,tyrion, m,tyrion, Including us? Eight.,4,8,3
9539,tyrion, m,tyrion," She loses the North. She loses the Vale, Sansa will make sure of that.",4,8,14
9540,tyrion, m,tyrion, He doesn't want the throne.,4,8,5
9541,tyrion, m,tyrion," He loves our queen. And she loves him. If we marry them, they could rule together.",4,8,16
9542,tyrion, m,tyrion, That never stopped a Targaryen before.,4,8,6
9543,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Something she has in common with every monarch who ever lived.,4,8,11
9544,tyrion, m,tyrion, We are advisors to the queen. Worrying about her state of mind is our job. We still have to take King's Landing. Maybe Cersei will win and kill us all. That would solve our problems.,4,8,35
9545,tyrion, m,tyrion," It could be a fortnight before Jon and the allied armies make it to King's Landing. In the meantime, demand Cersei surrender. Offer her her life in exchange for the throne. If there's a chance to avoid the coming slaughter, we should make the effort.",4,8,45
9546,tyrion, m,tyrion, She's a girl who walked into a fire with three stones and walked out with three dragons. How could she not believe in destiny?,4,8,24
9547,tyrion, m,tyrion, And how do you know she wasn't?,4,8,7
9548,tyrion, m,tyrion, He doesn't want the throne. That's why he bent the knee.,4,8,11
9549,tyrion, m,tyrion, We're discussing treason.,4,8,3
9550,tyrion, m,tyrion, Of course I've thought about it. Thoughts aren't treason.,4,8,9
9551,tyrion, m,tyrion," Joffrey was a man. I don't think a cock is a true qualification, as I'm sure you'd agree.",4,8,18
9552,tyrion, m,tyrion, What about my earlier proposal? They could rule together as king and queen.,4,8,13
9553,tyrion, m,tyrion, He could temper her worst impulses.,4,8,6
9554,tyrion, m,tyrion, How many kings and queens have you served? Five? Six? I've lost count.,4,8,13
9555,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  At a certain point, you choose a person you believe in, and you fight for that person.",4,8,17
9556,tyrion, m,tyrion, I believe in our queen. She'll make the right choice. With the help of her loyal advisors.,4,8,17
9557,tyrion, m,tyrion," What is the realm? A vast continent, home to millions of people, most of whom don't care who sits on the Iron Throne.",4,8,23
9558,tyrion, m,tyrion," So, what happens to her?",4,8,5
9559,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Please. Don't.,4,8,2
9560,tyrion, m,tyrion, Queen Daenerys demands Cersei's unconditional surrender and the immediate release of Missandei of Naath.,4,8,14
9561,tyrion, m,tyrion," Qyburn, you're a rational man.",4,8,5
9562,tyrion, m,tyrion," We have a chance here, perhaps our last chance, to avoid carnage.",4,8,12
9563,tyrion, m,tyrion, Help me. I don't want to see this city burn. I don't want to hear the screams of children burning alive.,4,8,21
9564,tyrion, m,tyrion, Your queen.,4,8,2
9565,tyrion, m,tyrion, Her reign is over. You understand this. Help her understand it.,4,8,11
9566,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  I know you don't care about your people. Why should you? They hate you and you hate them. But you're not a monster. I know this. I know this because I've seen it. You've always loved your children. More than yourself, more than Jaime more than anything. I beg you. If not for yourself, then for your child. Your reign is over, but that doesn't mean your life has to end. It doesn't mean your baby has to die.",4,8,79
9567,tyrion, m,tyrion, I'll find you later.,6,8,4
9568,tyrion, m,tyrion, I'm going alone.,6,8,3
9569,tyrion, m,tyrion, I freed my brother. And you slaughtered a city.,6,8,9
9570,tyrion, m,tyrion, Did you bring any wine?,6,8,5
9571,tyrion, m,tyrion, So is there life after death?,6,8,6
9572,tyrion, m,tyrion, I should be thankful. Oblivion is the best I could hope for. I strangled my lover. I shot my own father with a crossbow. I betrayed my queen.,6,8,28
9573,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  I did. And I'd do it again, now that I've seen what I've seen. I chose my fate. The people of King's Landing did not.",6,8,25
9574,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Is it? When you heard her talking to her soldiers, did she sound like someone who's done fighting?",6,8,18
9575,tyrion, m,tyrion, She liberated the people of Slaver's Bay. She liberated the people of King's Landing. And she'll go on liberating until the people of the world are free and she rules them all.,6,8,32
9576,tyrion, m,tyrion, Until today. Varys was right. I was wrong. It was vanity to think I could guide her. Our queen's nature is fire and blood.,6,8,24
9577,tyrion, m,tyrion," My father was an evil man. My sister was an evil woman. Pile up all the bodies of all the people they ever killed, there still won't be half as many as our beautiful queen slaughtered in a single day.",6,8,40
9578,tyrion, m,tyrion," The moment the gates fell, the battle was over.",6,8,9
9579,tyrion, m,tyrion, And she burned down a city for it.,6,8,8
9580,tyrion, m,tyrion, Would you have done it?,6,8,5
9581,tyrion, m,tyrion," You've been up there, on a dragon's back. You've had that power. Would you have burned the city down?",6,8,19
9582,tyrion, m,tyrion," (scoffs) Yes, you do. You won't say because you don't want to betray her but you know.",6,8,17
9583,tyrion, m,tyrion," It matters more than anything. When she murdered the slavers of Astapor, I'm sure no one but the slavers complained. After all, they were evil men.",6,8,26
9584,tyrion, m,tyrion," When she crucified hundreds of Meereenese nobles, who could argue? They were evil men. The Dothraki khals she burned alive? They would have done worse to her. Everywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer her for it. And she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right. She believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone. If you believed that if you truly believed it, wouldn't you kill whoever stood between you and paradise?",6,8,83
9585,tyrion, m,tyrion, I know you love her. I love her too. Not as successfully as you. But I believed in her with all my heart. Love is more powerful than reason. We all know that. Look at my brother.,6,8,37
9586,tyrion, m,tyrion, You just came up with that?,6,8,6
9587,tyrion, m,tyrion," Sometimes duty is the death of love. You are the shield that guards the realms of men. And you've always tried to do the right thing. No matter the cost, you've tried to protect people. Who is the greatest threat to the people now?",6,8,44
9588,tyrion, m,tyrion, It's a terrible thing I'm asking. It's also the right thing. Do you think I'm the last man she'll execute? Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?,6,8,32
9589,tyrion, m,tyrion, And your sisters? Do you see them bending the knee?,6,8,10
9590,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Why do you think Sansa told me the truth about you? Because she doesn't want Dany to be queen.,6,8,19
9591,tyrion, m,tyrion,  No. But you do. And you have to choose now.,6,8,10
9592,tyrion, m,tyrion, It's not for you to decide.,6,8,6
9593,tyrion, m,tyrion, (nods) You're right. And no one's any better for it. But it's not for you to decide. Jon committed his crime here. His fate is for our king to decide. Or our queen.,6,8,33
9594,tyrion, m,tyrion, You're the most powerful people in Westeros. Choose one.,6,8,9
9595,tyrion, m,tyrion," Me? The Imp? Half the people hate me for serving Daenerys, the other half hate me for betraying her.  Can't think of a worse choice.",6,8,25
9596,tyrion, m,tyrion, I've had nothing to do but think these past few weeks. About our bloody history. About the mistakes we've made.,6,8,20
9597,tyrion, m,tyrion," What unites people? Armies? Gold? Flags? Stories. There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story. Nothing can stop it. No enemy can defeat it. And who has a better story than Bran the Broken? The boy who fell from a high tower and lived. He knew he'd never walk again, so he learned to fly. He crossed beyond the Wall, a crippled boy, and became the Three-Eyed Raven. He is our memory, the keeper of all our stories. The wars, weddings, births, massacres, famines. Our triumphs, mm, our defeats, our past. Who better to lead us into the future?",6,8,102
9598,tyrion, m,tyrion," Good. Sons of kings can be cruel and stupid, as you well know. His will never torment us. That is the wheel our queen wanted to break.",6,8,27
9599,tyrion, m,tyrion," From now on, rulers will not be born. They will be chosen on this spot by the lords and ladies of Westeros to serve the realm.",6,8,26
9600,tyrion, m,tyrion," I know you don't want it. I know you don't care about power. But I ask you now, if we choose you will you wear the crown? Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms to the best of your abilities from this day until your last day?",6,8,46
9601,tyrion, m,tyrion, To Brandon of House Stark I say aye.,6,8,8
9602,tyrion, m,tyrion," All hail Bran the Broken, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.",6,8,27
9603,tyrion, m,tyrion," I don't deserve it. I thought I was wise, but I wasn't. I thought I knew what was right, but I didn't. Choose Ser Davos. Choose anyone else.",6,8,28
9604,tyrion, m,tyrion, Giving you to the Unsullied would start a war. Letting you walk free would start a war. So our new king has chosen to send you to the Night's Watch.,6,8,30
9605,tyrion, m,tyrion, The world will always need a home for bastards and broken men.,6,8,12
9606,tyrion, m,tyrion," You shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. The Unsullied wanted your head of course, but Grey Worm has accepted the justice of a life sentence. Sansa and Arya wanted you freed, but they understand our new king needs to make peace. No one is very happy. Which means it's a good compromise, I suppose.",6,8,58
9607,tyrion, m,tyrion, What we did.,6,8,3
9608,tyrion, m,tyrion, Ask me again in 10 years.,6,8,6
9609,tyrion, m,tyrion, I wouldn't be so sure. A few years as Hand of the King would make anyone want to piss off the edge of the world.,6,8,25
9610,tyrion, m,tyrion, What's this?,6,8,2
9611,tyrion, m,tyrion, I suppose I come in for some heavy criticism.,6,8,9
9612,tyrion, m,tyrion," Oh, he's kind to me. Never would've guessed.",6,8,8
9613,tyrion, m,tyrion, He's not kind?,6,8,3
9614,tyrion, m,tyrion, He what? What does he say about me?,6,8,8
9615,tyrion, m,tyrion, Your Grace.,6,8,2
9616,tyrion, m,tyrion," Yes, Your Grace. Suitable prospects will be brought to you for an audience in the coming weeks.",6,8,17
9617,tyrion, m,tyrion," As you wish, Your Grace.",6,8,5
9618,tyrion, m,tyrion," (clearing his throat) We serve at your pleasure, King Bran the Broken, ruler of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. Long may he reign.",6,8,26
9619,tyrion, m,tyrion, That will improve.,6,8,3
9620,tyrion, m,tyrion," Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, Lord of Highgarden, Lord Paramount of the Reach and Master of Coin, would you say the crown's debt to you has been paid?",6,8,28
9621,tyrion, m,tyrion, Good. Time to start incurring a new one. We have hungry people to feed. Can we expect some assistance in this regard?,6,8,22
9622,tyrion, m,tyrion," Lord Davos, we have an armada to rebuild and ports to repair.",6,8,12
9623,tyrion, m,tyrion, Find the best builders and set them to the task.,6,8,10
9624,tyrion, m,tyrion, I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel.,6,8,11
9625,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Oh, do continue. Didn't mean to interrupt.",9,1,7
9626,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Shagga likes axes.,9,1,3
9627,tyrion, m,tyrion,  The vanguard? Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?,9,1,10
9628,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Ferocious? Last night a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay.",9,1,54
9629,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort.,9,1,17
9630,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  lt appears l'm not hungry after all. Excuse me, my lords.",9,1,11
9631,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Where did you find one so pretty at this hour?,9,1,10
9632,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Took her? From whom?,9,1,4
9633,tyrion, m,tyrion,  And he didn't have anything to say about it?,9,1,9
9634,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically. We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow.",9,1,22
9635,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Who are you?,9,1,3
9636,tyrion, m,tyrion,  What did your mother call you?,9,1,6
9637,tyrion, m,tyrion,  My mother died giving birth to me.,9,1,7
9638,tyrion, m,tyrion,  What sort of accent is that?,9,1,6
9639,tyrion, m,tyrion,  For-,9,1,1
9640,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  What do l want from you? l want you to share my tent. l want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride. l want you to take no other man to bed for as long as we're together. And l want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world. Which it may well be.",9,1,70
9641,tyrion, m,tyrion,  No.,9,1,1
9642,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Ah! Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain?",9,1,9
9643,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Let's play a new game.,9,1,5
9644,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?,9,1,8
9645,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  No! No fire games, no knife games. Let's do something l'm good at.",9,1,13
9646,tyrion, m,tyrion,  l happen to be a great judge of character.,9,1,9
9647,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Fine. Bronn first. Your father beat you.,9,1,7
9648,tyrion, m,tyrion,  You killed your first man before you were 12.,9,1,9
9649,tyrion, m,tyrion,  You've been north of the Wall.,9,1,6
9650,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  And you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again. Oh, wait, that's me. (Tyrion drinks) Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty.",9,1,33
9651,tyrion, m,tyrion,  lt's fun! Look at the fun we're having. Your mother was a whore.,9,1,13
9652,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  All right. Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return.",9,1,15
9653,tyrion, m,tyrion,  And we've established the rules about lying?,9,1,7
9654,tyrion, m,tyrion,  You wanted a different life. You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.,9,1,15
9655,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  So, specifics… You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? l don't believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you. So, what's a lowborn girl to do?",9,1,32
9656,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Are you sure –,9,1,4
9657,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  My dear lady, if l have offended you, l apologize.",9,1,10
9658,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Fine, fine. Ask away. Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.",9,1,12
9659,tyrion, m,tyrion,  That's not how the game works.,9,1,6
9660,tyrion, m,tyrion,  How did you hear that?,9,1,5
9661,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Another night, perhaps.",9,1,3
9662,tyrion, m,tyrion,  lt's not a pleasant story.,9,1,5
9663,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  So l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls. how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow l found myself in her bed.",9,1,156
9664,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Really? l was 16, drunk and in love.",9,1,8
9665,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  As l said, l was young and stupid.",9,1,8
9666,tyrion, m,tyrion,  What is it? What do you want?,9,1,7
9667,tyrion, m,tyrion,  What?,9,1,1
9668,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Get my squire!,9,1,3
9669,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  lf l die, weep for me.",9,1,6
9670,tyrion, m,tyrion,  l'll know.,9,1,2
9671,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Stay low?,9,1,2
9672,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  l was born lucky. Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round! Stone Crows! Black Ears! Burned Men! Moon Brothers! And Painted Dogs! Your dominion over the Vale begins now! Onward, to claim what is yours!",9,1,34
9673,tyrion, m,tyrion,  To battle!,9,1,2
9674,tyrion, m,tyrion,  l'm alive?,9,1,2
9675,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Did we win?,9,1,3
9676,tyrion, m,tyrion,  How did our tribesmen do?,9,1,5
9677,tyrion, m,tyrion,  lt's nice to see them getting along.,9,1,7
9678,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Good of you to notice. l hear we won.,9,1,9
9679,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Did we get the Stark boy, at least?",9,1,8
9680,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Where was he?,9,1,3
9681,tyrion, m,tyrion,  And where are they?,9,1,4
9682,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  If I'm going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart.",8,1,16
9683,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Starve, most likely.",8,1,3
9684,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  What do you want, Bronn? Gold? Women? Golden women?",8,1,9
9685,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Though I would treasure your friendship.,8,1,6
9686,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Come, share our fire.",8,1,4
9687,tyrion, m,tyrion,  I am Tyrion son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.,8,1,9
9688,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  In my own bed, at the age of 80 with a bellyful of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock.",8,1,21
9689,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  No no no no no! My, my House is rich and powerful.",8,1,12
9690,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Half a man maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies.",8,1,15
9691,tyrion, m,tyrion,  That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns.,8,1,10
9692,tyrion, m,tyrion,  The Vale of Arryn.,8,1,4
9693,tyrion, m,tyrion,  From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.,8,1,12
9694,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  And feed it to the goats, yes.",8,1,7
9695,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Uncle. Father.,8,1,2
9696,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Sorry to disappoint you.,8,1,4
9697,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  May I present My Lord Father, Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister.",8,1,13
9698,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  We have our differences, Jaime and I.",8,1,7
9699,tyrion, m,tyrion,  And the Starks? Lord Eddard?,8,1,5
9700,tyrion, m,tyrion,  How did my sweet sister persuade the King to imprison his dear friend Ned?,8,1,14
9701,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  My sister rules, you mean.",8,1,5
9702,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Maybe. Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.,8,1,9
9703,tyrion, m,tyrion,  The Stark boy appears to be less green than we'd hoped.,10,1,11
9704,tyrion, m,tyrion,  There's your peace. Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Stark's head. You'll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now. He's winning – in case you hadn't noticed.,10,1,42
9705,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Half wrong. l'm new to strategy, but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can't stay here.",10,1,22
9706,tyrion, m,tyrion,  And do what?,10,1,3
9707,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Heads, spikes, walls. Why not my uncle? Why not anyone? Why me?",10,1,12
9708,tyrion, m,tyrion,  So it would seem.,10,1,4
9709,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  No, he said l couldn't take  you with me to King's Landing. He was very specific on that point.",10,1,19
9710,tyrion, m,tyrion,  What?,10,1,1
9711,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  l believe he used the word ""whore"".",10,1,7
9712,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  My father's probably the most powerful man in the country. Certainly the richest. He has all Seven Kingdoms in his pockets. Everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says. He's always been a cunt. l believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you. Why don't you come with me, be the Hand's lady? Because the King needs a Hand and the Hand – (Shae kisses Tyrion)",10,1,77
9713,tyrion, m,tyrion, A charming man.,3,1,3
9714,tyrion, m,tyrion," And how's that going, Commander Mormont?",3,1,6
9715,tyrion, m,tyrion, Good news or bad?,3,1,4
9716,tyrion, m,tyrion,  I'm looking at you. You've got an interesting face. Very distinctive faces. All of you.,3,1,15
9717,tyrion, m,tyrion," It's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it.",3,1,22
9718,tyrion, m,tyrion, It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Your brother Bran. He's woken up.,3,1,38
9719,tyrion, m,tyrion, You're joking?,3,1,2
9720,tyrion, m,tyrion, And how do a bear's balls taste?,3,1,7
9721,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?",3,1,22
9722,tyrion, m,tyrion, They have a better chance finding feed than glory.,3,1,9
9723,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny.",3,1,20
9724,tyrion, m,tyrion," Do you think I'm plump? Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?",3,1,12
9725,tyrion, m,tyrion,  I'm not sure what I've done to offend you. I have great admiration for the Night's Watch. I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.,3,1,25
9726,tyrion, m,tyrion," But... I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall. I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it.",3,1,45
9727,tyrion, m,tyrion," I think he's starting to like me. ""Going below""?",3,1,9
9728,tyrion, m,tyrion, So you're heading down to King's Landing too.,3,1,8
9729,tyrion, m,tyrion, Let's share the road. I could use some decent company.,3,1,10
9730,tyrion, m,tyrion,  Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns. No one turns away a Lannister.,3,1,18
9731,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Eight... no, nine.",3,1,3
9732,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon.",3,1,13
9733,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids.",3,1,10
9734,tyrion, m,tyrion, It's either me or this cold. And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.,3,1,14
9735,tyrion, m,tyrion,  I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.,3,1,16
9736,tyrion, m,tyrion, Of course.,3,1,2
9737,tyrion, m,tyrion," If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. Take care, Snow.",3,1,17
9738,tyrion, m,tyrion," Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies.",2,1,15
9739,tyrion, m,tyrion, None. But it is expected of you. Your absence has already been noted.,2,1,13
9740,tyrion, m,tyrion, One word and I'll hit you again.,2,1,7
9741,tyrion, m,tyrion," Go! Tell her. But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand?",2,1,49
9742,tyrion, m,tyrion, Do you understand?,2,1,3
9743,tyrion, m,tyrion," I hope so. If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him. Time for breakfast...",2,1,16
9744,tyrion, m,tyrion," Bread. And two of those little fish. And a mug of dark beer to wash it down. And bacon, burnt black.",2,1,21
9745,tyrion, m,tyrion, Beloved siblings.,2,1,2
9746,tyrion, m,tyrion, Apparently not.,2,1,2
9747,tyrion, m,tyrion, The Maester says the boy may live.,2,1,7
9748,tyrion, m,tyrion, Only the gods know for certain. All the rest of us can do is pray. The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you.,2,1,25
9749,tyrion, m,tyrion," Where's your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers.",2,1,24
9750,tyrion, m,tyrion, And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.,2,1,31
9751,tyrion, m,tyrion," Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree. Death is so final, whereas life... Life is full of possibilities. I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say.",2,1,36
9752,tyrion, m,tyrion," My dear brother, you wound me. You know how much I love my family.",2,1,14
9753,tyrion, m,tyrion, Rapers. They were given a choice no doubt... Castration or the Wall. Most choose the knife. Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch... You discard your old family and get a whole new one.,2,1,38
9754,tyrion, m,tyrion, Look at me and tell me what you see.,2,1,9
9755,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  What you see is a dwarf. If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years.",2,1,47
9756,tyrion, m,tyrion," Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard?",2,1,78
9757,tyrion, m,tyrion,"  A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms.",2,1,21
9758,tyrion, m,tyrion," Yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. You're a smart boy. You don't believe that nonsense... Everything's better with some wine in the belly.",2,1,34
9759,tyrion, m,tyrion, Mmh. It is true what they say about the Northern girls.,1,1,11
9760,tyrion, m,tyrion, I did hear something about that.,1,1,6
9761,tyrion, m,tyrion, And the other brother?,1,1,4
9762,tyrion, m,tyrion, There’s the pretty one. And there’s the clever one.,1,1,9
9763,tyrion, m,tyrion, I hear he hates that nickname.,1,1,6
9764,tyrion, m,tyrion, Clever girl.,1,1,2
9765,tyrion, m,tyrion, Have you?,1,1,2
9766,tyrion, m,tyrion, The gods gave me one blessing.,1,1,6
9767,tyrion, m,tyrion," Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?",1,1,15
9768,tyrion, m,tyrion," She has odd cravings, our sister.",1,1,6
9769,tyrion, m,tyrion," I’m sorry, I’ve begun the feast a bit early. And this is the first of many courses.",1,1,17
9770,tyrion, m,tyrion, Close the door!,1,1,3
9771,tyrion, m,tyrion, Your uncle’s in the Night’s Watch.,1,1,6
9772,tyrion, m,tyrion, Preparing for a night with your family. I’ve always wanted to see the Wall.,1,1,14
9773,tyrion, m,tyrion," My greatest accomplishment. You – you’re Ned Stark’s bastard, aren’t you?",1,1,11
9774,tyrion, m,tyrion," Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though.",1,1,10
9775,tyrion, m,tyrion," And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you.",1,1,43
9776,tyrion, m,tyrion, All dwarves are bastards in their fathers’ eyes.,1,1,8
9777,tyrion, m,tyrion," If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other, it will be a miracle.",1,1,18
9778,tyrion, m,tyrion, The greatest in the land. My spear never misses.,1,1,9
9779,tyrion, m,tyrion, This isn't the Kingsroad. You said we were riding for Winterfell.,5,1,11
9780,tyrion, m,tyrion," Very wise. They'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place. Word's probably gotten to my father by now. He'll be offering a handsome reward. Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts. Would you be so good as to untie me?",5,1,45
9781,tyrion, m,tyrion, Why not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots. Unless a Shadowcat ate me first.,5,1,22
9782,tyrion, m,tyrion," Ah... the Eastern Road. We're going to The Vale. You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes. Tell me, Lady Stark. When was the last time you saw your sister?",5,1,34
9783,tyrion, m,tyrion," She's changed. She was always a bit touched, but now... you might as well kill me here.",5,1,17
9784,tyrion, m,tyrion, Neither am I! I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life!,5,1,15
9785,tyrion, m,tyrion, What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?,5,1,11
9786,tyrion, m,tyrion, Why? Am I starting to make sense?,5,1,7
9787,tyrion, m,tyrion," Untie me. If I die, what's the point?",5,1,8
9788,tyrion, m,tyrion," Well, I'm willing if she is.",5,1,6
9789,tyrion, m,tyrion, The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.,5,1,6
9790,tyrion, m,tyrion, I like you.,5,1,3
9791,tyrion, m,tyrion, Oh? Did I kill him too? I've been a very busy man.,5,1,12
9792,tyrion, m,tyrion," If any harm comes to me, my brother, Jaime, will see that they do.",5,1,14
9793,tyrion, m,tyrion,  I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.,4,1,13
9794,tyrion, m,tyrion," Any man of the Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy?",4,1,11
9795,tyrion, m,tyrion, Then you might learn a lord's courtesy.,4,1,7
9796,tyrion, m,tyrion, So it's true. Hello Bran. Do you remember anything about what happened?,4,1,12
9797,tyrion, m,tyrion, Curious.,4,1,1
9798,tyrion, m,tyrion, Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel? My neck is beginning to hurt.,4,1,16
9799,tyrion, m,tyrion," Do you like to ride, Bran?",4,1,6
9800,tyrion, m,tyrion," What of it? With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride.",4,1,14
9801,tyrion, m,tyrion, Then I'm not a dwarf. My father will rejoice to hear it. I have a gift for you. Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest. You must shape the horse to the rider. Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.,4,1,52
9802,tyrion, m,tyrion,You will. On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.,4,1,13
9803,tyrion, m,tyrion," I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things.",4,1,14
9804,tyrion, m,tyrion," Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark. There's a brothel outside your walls. There I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier.",4,1,25
9805,tyrion, m,tyrion," Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you. Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters.",4,1,16
9806,tyrion, m,tyrion," No, of course not. What happened here? Where is lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me?",4,1,16
9807,tyrion, m,tyrion," She's not in Winterfell, is she? Where did she go?",4,1,10
9808,tyrion, m,tyrion," My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching. Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport. I believe your uncles were responsible?",4,1,46
9809,tyrion, m,tyrion," Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive. Yes, a great victory for your people. Shame how it all turned out.",4,1,20
9810,tyrion, m,tyrion," A stupid rebellion then. I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle. Now here you are, your enemy's squire.",4,1,23
9811,tyrion, m,tyrion," I've offended you. Forgive me, it's been a rough morning. Anyway, don't despair. I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it. Your next tumble with Ros is on me. I'll try not to wear her out.",4,1,43
9812,tyrion, m,tyrion," My men can sleep in the stable. As for myself, I don't require a large room.",4,1,16
9813,tyrion, m,tyrion, Is there nothing I can do... to remedy this?,4,1,9
9814,tyrion, m,tyrion," There's a clever man. You can manage food, I trust? Yoren, dine with me.",4,1,14
9815,tyrion, m,tyrion, Nothing would more likely ruin my supper. Lady Stark! What an unexpected pleasure. I was sorry to have missed you at Winterfell.,4,1,22
9816,tyrion, m,tyrion," I envy your father all his fine friends, but I don't quite see the purpose of this.",4,1,17
9817,tyrion, m,tyrion, Mord! Turnkey! Mord! Mord!,6,1,4
9818,tyrion, m,tyrion, How would you like to be rich?,6,1,7
9819,tyrion, m,tyrion," My family is rich. We have gold, lots of gold. I’m prepared to give you lots of gold.",6,1,18
9820,tyrion, m,tyrion," Well, I don’t have it here.",6,1,6
9821,tyrion, m,tyrion, Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord!,6,1,5
9822,tyrion, m,tyrion, About the gold -,6,1,4
9823,tyrion, m,tyrion," Listen to me! Listen to me! Sometimes possession… is an abstract concept. When they captured me they took my purse, but the gold is still mine.",6,1,26
9824,tyrion, m,tyrion," Where? I don’t know where, but when they free me -",6,1,11
9825,tyrion, m,tyrion," Have you ever heard the phrase “Rich as a Lannister”? Of course you have. You’re a smart man. You know who the Lannisters are. I am a Lannister. Tyrion, son of Tywin! And of course, you have also heard the phrase, “a Lannister always pays his debts.” If you deliver a message from me to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt. I will owe you gold. If you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do.",6,1,83
9826,tyrion, m,tyrion, Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.,6,1,8
9827,tyrion, m,tyrion," Yes, my lady. I do, my lady.",6,1,7
9828,tyrion, m,tyrion," Where do I begin, my lords and ladies? I’m a vile man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond counting. I have lied and cheated, gambled and whored. I’m not particularly good at violence, but I’m good at convincing others to do violence for me. You want specifics, I suppose. When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle, naked and in tears. I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was ten, I stuffed my uncle’s boots with goatshit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and… I escaped justice. When I was twelve, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel -",6,1,178
9829,tyrion, m,tyrion, Confessing my crimes.,6,1,3
9830,tyrion, m,tyrion," Oh, I’m very sorry. I don’t know anything about all that.",6,1,11
9831,tyrion, m,tyrion," Is this how justice is done in the Vale? you accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me in a cell to freeze and starve? Where is the King’s Justice? I’m accused and demand a trial.",6,1,39
9832,tyrion, m,tyrion, I understand the law.,6,1,4
9833,tyrion, m,tyrion, No need to bother Lord Robin. I demand a trial by combat.,6,1,12
9834,tyrion, m,tyrion, Agreed.,6,1,1
9835,tyrion, m,tyrion," Now I demand a champion. I have that right, same as you.",6,1,12
9836,tyrion, m,tyrion," I wouldn’t be too glad, ser. I name my brother, Jaime Lannister.",6,1,12
9837,tyrion, m,tyrion," Send a raven for him, I’m happy to wait.",6,1,9
9838,tyrion, m,tyrion, Do I have a volunteer?,6,1,5
9839,tyrion, m,tyrion, Anyone?... Anyone?,6,1,2
9840,tyrion, m,tyrion, Not this little man. This little man is going home. I believe you have something of mine.,6,1,17
9841,tyrion, m,tyrion, A Lannister always pays his debts.,6,1,6
9842,tyrion, m,tyrion," Despite appearances, I think you’ll find the city’s on the rise.",9,6,11
9843,tyrion, m,tyrion, Perhaps we should take shelter.,9,6,5
9844,tyrion, m,tyrion, Meereen is strong. Commerce has returned to the markets. The people are behind you.,9,6,14
9845,tyrion, m,tyrion," Well, not all the people, of course. No ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people. But the rebirth of Meereen is the cause of this violence. The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed. Because if Meereen succeeds, a city without slavery, a city without Masters…",9,6,48
9846,tyrion, m,tyrion, ...it proves that no one needs a Master.,9,6,8
9847,tyrion, m,tyrion, Do we have a plan?,9,6,5
9848,tyrion, m,tyrion, You once told me you knew what your father was. Did you know his plans for King’s Landing when the Lannister armies were at his gates?,9,6,26
9849,tyrion, m,tyrion," Probably not. Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me. He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep, the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor, all the major thoroughfares. He would have burned every one of his citizens. The loyal ones and the trators. Every man, woman, and child. That’s why Jaime killed him.",9,6,56
9850,tyrion, m,tyrion, You’re talking about destroying cities. It’s not entirely different. I’d like to suggest an alternate approach.,9,6,16
9851,tyrion, m,tyrion," We are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults.",9,6,12
9852,tyrion, m,tyrion," Thank you for the armada. Our queen does love ships. Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact. You violated that pact. You declared war upon us. Though our queen does have a forgiving nature, this cannot be forgiven.",9,6,40
9853,tyrion, m,tyrion," It always seems a bit abstract, doesn’t it, other people dying?",9,6,11
9854,tyrion, m,tyrion," Tell your people what happened here. Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty. When they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory, remind the what happened when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen.",9,6,48
9855,tyrion, m,tyrion," Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes? You were making jokes about my height, I seem to recall. Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf’s height thinks he’s the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf’s height. “The height of nobility,” “a man of your stature,” “someone to look up to.” You’re all making the same five or six jokes.",9,6,67
9856,tyrion, m,tyrion," It was. And how have things been going for you since then? Not so well, I gather. Can’t imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well.",9,6,32
9857,tyrion, m,tyrion," Doesn’t seem like it. He’s still alive. It was complicated for you, I’m sure, growing up at Winterfell. Never quite knowing who you were. But then, we all live complicated lives, don’t we?",9,6,33
9858,tyrion, m,tyrion, We can agree upon that at least.,9,6,7
9859,tyrion, m,tyrion," With the former Masters’ fleet, possibly. Barely. There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet.",9,6,17
9860,tyrion, m,tyrion, The Seven Kingdoms.,9,6,3
9861,tyrion, m,tyrion, What if everyone starts demanding their independence?,9,6,7
9862,tyrion, m,tyrion, I’d call that a successful gambit.,8,6,6
9863,tyrion, m,tyrion, Look around. The city has come back to life.,8,6,9
9864,tyrion, m,tyrion, I did and it worked.,8,6,5
9865,tyrion, m,tyrion, Spoken like a man who has never had to shave.,8,6,10
9866,tyrion, m,tyrion, I’m going to miss you.,8,6,5
9867,tyrion, m,tyrion, I hope you’re right about this expedition of yours.,8,6,9
9868,tyrion, m,tyrion," Most of all, we need our queen.",8,6,7
9869,tyrion, m,tyrion, Varys.,8,6,1
9870,tyrion, m,tyrion, The most famous dwarf in the world.,8,6,7
9871,tyrion, m,tyrion," I am happy. You should both be as well. Not so long ago, this city was ready to devour itself.",8,6,20
9872,tyrion, m,tyrion, Now it’s like a man reborn.,8,6,6
9873,tyrion, m,tyrion, Why don’t you drink? Why don’t either of you ever drink?,8,6,11
9874,tyrion, m,tyrion, Why not?,8,6,2
9875,tyrion, m,tyrion, And who made these rules? Your former masters?,8,6,8
9876,tyrion, m,tyrion, Those miserable old shits didn’t want you to be human. Have a drink with me.,8,6,15
9877,tyrion, m,tyrion, And you? What’s your excuse?,8,6,5
9878,tyrion, m,tyrion, That’s how you know it’s working.,8,6,6
9879,tyrion, m,tyrion, Here’s to our queen. Anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen.,8,6,11
9880,tyrion, m,tyrion," To Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains, long may she reign.",8,6,13
9881,tyrion, m,tyrion, Do you like it?,8,6,4
9882,tyrion, m,tyrion," Yes, yes. Fermentation. One day, after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms...I’d like to have my own vineyard. Make my own wine. The Imp’s Delight. Only my close friends could drink it.",8,6,33
9883,tyrion, m,tyrion," Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath.",8,6,7
9884,tyrion, m,tyrion, Grey worm?,8,6,2
9885,tyrion, m,tyrion," ...but when the barkeep brings them over, each of them finds a fly in his cup. The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup aside and demands another. The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole. The Stark reaches into his cup, pulls out the fly and shouts, “Spit it out, you see shit. Spit it out.”",8,6,57
9886,tyrion, m,tyrion, It’s funnier in Westeros.,8,6,4
9887,tyrion, m,tyrion, Yes.,8,6,1
9888,tyrion, m,tyrion," A story that’s supposed to make you laugh, ideally. Not at the moment, perhaps.",8,6,14
9889,tyrion, m,tyrion," Missandei, do you like the wine?",8,6,6
9890,tyrion, m,tyrion, Tell a joke.,8,6,3
9891,tyrion, m,tyrion, You lied to us.,8,6,4
9892,tyrion, m,tyrion, I was wrong. I admit it.,8,6,6
9893,tyrion, m,tyrion," All right, what should the army do?",8,6,7
9894,tyrion, m,tyrion, And then?,8,6,2
9895,tyrion, m,tyrion, How did he take it?,10,6,5
9896,tyrion, m,tyrion," I know it was hard for you. You turned away a man who truly loves you because he would have been a liability in the Seven Kingdoms. That’s the kind of self-sacrifice that makes for a good ruler, if it’s any consolation.",10,6,42
9897,tyrion, m,tyrion," No, I suppose not. I’m terrible at consoling.",10,6,8
9898,tyrion, m,tyrion," All right, how about the fact that this is actually happening? You have your armies, you have your ships, you have your dragons. Everything you’ve ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything. It’s all yours for the taking. Are you afraid?",10,6,44
9899,tyrion, m,tyrion, Good. You’re in the great game now. And the great game’s terrifying. The only people who aren’t afraid of failure are madmen like your father.,10,6,25
9900,tyrion, m,tyrion, He wasn’t the first to love you and he won’t be the last.,10,6,13
9901,tyrion, m,tyrion," I believe in you. It’s embarrassing, really. I’d swear you my sword, but I don’t actually own a sword.",10,6,19
9902,tyrion, m,tyrion, It’s yours. Now and always.,10,6,5
9903,tyrion, m,tyrion," What should we do while we wait? To pass the time, what should we do? What should we talk about?",3,6,20
9904,tyrion, m,tyrion, You speak 19 languages. You must occasionally use some of them to talk about things.,3,6,15
9905,tyrion, m,tyrion," You two, you spend a great deal of time together. What would you be talking about if I weren’t here?",3,6,20
9906,tyrion, m,tyrion, That’s good. That’s very good.,3,6,5
9907,tyrion, m,tyrion, But that’s a report. I was thinking more of a conversation. A wise man once said the truth history of the world is the history of great conversation in elegant rooms.,3,6,31
9908,tyrion, m,tyrion," Me. Just now. All right, no conversations. Let’s play a game.",3,6,11
9909,tyrion, m,tyrion," You don’t play games, either one of you, ever?",3,6,9
9910,tyrion, m,tyrion," There, that’s a start.",3,6,4
9911,tyrion, m,tyrion," Oh no, no, no. Not that, of course not that. Innocent games, fun games, drinking games.",3,6,16
9912,tyrion, m,tyrion, Until you do.,3,6,3
9913,tyrion, m,tyrion," Oh, you took your time.",3,6,5
9914,tyrion, m,tyrion, You see? You don’t even have to worry about the local rebellion. We only have to worry about the three rich foreign cities paying for it.,3,6,26
9915,tyrion, m,tyrion," If the Unsullied march off to reconquer Asatapor and Yunkai, who remain to defend the free people of Meereen?",3,6,19
9916,tyrion, m,tyrion, You may be right.,3,6,4
9917,tyrion, m,tyrion, Possibly.,3,6,1
9918,tyrion, m,tyrion, It’s a conversation.,3,6,3
9919,tyrion, m,tyrion," Tell me, can the little birds get a message to the good Masters of Astapor, the wise Masters of Yunkai, the benevolent enslavers of Volantis?",3,6,25
9920,tyrion, m,tyrion," If I lost my cock, I’d drink all the time.",2,6,10
9921,tyrion, m,tyrion," Meaning no offense. He makes dwarf jokes, I make eunuch jokes.",2,6,11
9922,tyrion, m,tyrion, You think them.,2,6,3
9923,tyrion, m,tyrion, Surely there’s some good news lurking somewhere.,2,6,7
9924,tyrion, m,tyrion, Perhaps they can tell us their secret.,2,6,7
9925,tyrion, m,tyrion, What about the dragons? We have two of them here beneath the pyramid.,2,6,13
9926,tyrion, m,tyrion," Daenerys is the dragon queen. Can’t very well let the dragons starve, that’s obvious.",2,6,14
9927,tyrion, m,tyrion, Dragons do not do well in captivity.,2,6,7
9928,tyrion, m,tyrion, That’s what I do. I drink and I know things.,2,6,10
9929,tyrion, m,tyrion," The dragons Aegon used to conquer Westeros ranged over hundreds of miles. Then Daenerys’s ancestors started chaining them up in pens. A few generations later, the last dragons were no larger than cats. They must be unchained or they’ll waste away. Missandei, how many times were you in the company of these dragons?",2,6,53
9930,tyrion, m,tyrion, And did they ever harm you?,2,6,6
9931,tyrion, m,tyrion, Dragons are intelligent. More intelligent than men according to some maesters. They have affection for their friends and fury for their enemies. I am their friend.,2,6,26
9932,tyrion, m,tyrion, They will. It’s time they had their supper.,2,6,8
9933,tyrion, m,tyrion, I’m friends with your mother. I’m here to help. Don’t eat the help.,2,6,13
9934,tyrion, m,tyrion," When I was a child an uncle asked what gift I wanted for my name day. I begged him for one of you. “It wouldn’t even have to be a big dragon,” I told him. “It could be little, like me.”",2,6,41
9935,tyrion, m,tyrion, Everyone laughed like it was the funniest thing they had ever heard. Then my father told me the last dragon had died a century ago. I cried myself to sleep that night.,2,6,32
9936,tyrion, m,tyrion, But here you are.,2,6,4
9937,tyrion, m,tyrion," Next time I have an idea like that, punch me in the face.",2,6,13
9938,tyrion, m,tyrion, We’re never going to fix what’s wrong with this city from the top of an 800-foot pyramid.,1,6,17
9939,tyrion, m,tyrion, We’ll be fine. We’re dressed like common merchants.,1,6,8
9940,tyrion, m,tyrion, You’ve spent a lot of time studying the way rich people walk?,1,6,12
9941,tyrion, m,tyrion, It’s a good thing you’re not a boy anymore...because you have no cock.,1,6,13
9942,tyrion, m,tyrion, For your baby. To eat.,1,6,5
9943,tyrion, m,tyrion, I know what mhysa means.,1,6,5
9944,tyrion, m,tyrion, Hard to know. Our queen is not as popular in Meereen as she used to be.,1,6,16
9945,tyrion, m,tyrion," Very possibly. Daenerys Targaryen took away their most valuable property, told them human beings weren’t even property to begin with. You can see why they’re unhappy. Of course, it could also be the freed men.",1,6,35
9946,tyrion, m,tyrion, Many of the former slaves feel that Daenerys has abandoned them.,1,6,11
9947,tyrion, m,tyrion, It’s a problem.,1,6,3
9948,tyrion, m,tyrion," Fear has brought Meereen to a standstill. Whoever you are, wherever you go, someone in this city wants to murder you. We can’t fight an enemy we don’t know.",1,6,29
9949,tyrion, m,tyrion, And have you started looking for that someone?,1,6,8
9950,tyrion, m,tyrion," Well, we won’t be sailing to Westeros anytime soon.",1,6,9
9951,tyrion, m,tyrion, It’s not enough.,5,6,3
9952,tyrion, m,tyrion," It’s not enough for Meereen to have peace. They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it. The Sons of the Harpy have a good story. Resist the foreign invaders. Our queen has an even better story. Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and...all that.",5,6,45
9953,tyrion, m,tyrion," Yes, but do they know who brought them security? Who brought about an end to the violence? We need someone the people trust, someone they know who cannot be bought or influenced.",5,6,32
9954,tyrion, m,tyrion, Who said anything about “him”?,5,6,5
9955,tyrion, m,tyrion, Welcome to Meereen.,5,6,3
9956,tyrion, m,tyrion, That’s about the extent of my Valyrian.,5,6,7
9957,tyrion, m,tyrion, Thank you for travelling all this way. I know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be.,5,6,18
9958,tyrion, m,tyrion, The truth is we need your help. We had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to --,5,6,18
9959,tyrion, m,tyrion, Yes.,5,6,1
9960,tyrion, m,tyrion, She did indeed.,5,6,3
9961,tyrion, m,tyrion, Ideally we’d avoid purifying too many nonbelievers. The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths.,5,6,17
9962,tyrion, m,tyrion, I’d settle for obeyed.,5,6,4
9963,tyrion, m,tyrion, That sounds most excellent --,5,6,5
9964,tyrion, m,tyrion, We’d be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen.,5,6,12
9965,tyrion, m,tyrion," My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion, but we are all loyal supporters of the queen.",5,6,17
9966,tyrion, m,tyrion," I did. As a clever man once told me, “We make peace with our enemies, not our friends.”",4,6,18
9967,tyrion, m,tyrion," Yes, that’s the military approach. And how has that worked here in Meereen? I represent the diplomatic approach.",4,6,18
9968,tyrion, m,tyrion, Long enough to know.,4,6,4
9969,tyrion, m,tyrion, And now you speak for the Good Masters of Astapor.Here’s to reversals of fortune.,4,6,14
9970,tyrion, m,tyrion," Let’s make this simple, shall we? Tell me what you want.",4,6,11
9971,tyrion, m,tyrion, Queen Daenerys won’t stay in Meereen forever. Her path takes her westward.,4,6,12
9972,tyrion, m,tyrion," Friends, friends, friends, please.",4,6,4
9973,tyrion, m,tyrion, There have always been those with wealth and power and those with nothing. That is the way of the world. I’m not here to change the way of the world.,4,6,30
9974,tyrion, m,tyrion, You don’t need slaves to make money. There haven’t been slaves in Westeros for hundreds of years and I grew up richer than any of you. But our queen recognizes that she erred by abolishing slavery without providing a new system to replace it. So here is the queen’s proposal. Slavery will never return to Meereen but she will give the other cities of Slaver’s Bay time to adjust to the new order.,4,6,73
9975,tyrion, m,tyrion," Instead of abolishing slavery overnight, we will give you seven years to end the practice.",4,6,15
9976,tyrion, m,tyrion," Slaveholders will be compensated for their losses, of course, at fair prices. In exchange, you will cut off your support for the Sons of the Harpy.",4,6,26
9977,tyrion, m,tyrion," Fine, fine, but you will cut it off all the same. I do hope you accept, my friends. You will not receive a better offer.",4,6,25
9978,tyrion, m,tyrion, Let us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it. And as a parting gift to our honored guests…,4,6,23
9979,tyrion, m,tyrion, Give freedom a chance. See if it doesn’t taste every bit as good as what came before.,4,6,17
9980,tyrion, m,tyrion, My friends! Large sorry...you wait so fat time.,4,6,8
9981,tyrion, m,tyrion, Excellent.,4,6,1
9982,tyrion, m,tyrion, I did.,4,6,2
9983,tyrion, m,tyrion, I imagine this room was built so the rulers could intimidate the ruled.,4,6,13
9984,tyrion, m,tyrion, But I am not your ruler. I’m not the Breaker of Chains. I’m not the Unburnt. And I am certainly not the Mother of Dragons.,4,6,25
9985,tyrion, m,tyrion, Because our queen chose me as her advisor. Until she returns from her travels --,4,6,15
9986,tyrion, m,tyrion, Soon. You have my word.,4,6,5
9987,tyrion, m,tyrion," And that is exactly why Grey Worm took part in these negotiations. As commander of the Unsullied, he knows hot to defeat the slavers and he knows when it is time to make peace.",4,6,34
9988,tyrion, m,tyrion, We offered terms.,4,6,3
9989,tyrion, m,tyrion, Those men respect you.,4,6,4
9990,tyrion, m,tyrion, As do I.,4,6,3
9991,tyrion, m,tyrion, I am not betraying her work. I am trying to save her city.,4,6,13
9992,tyrion, m,tyrion, For a short time.,4,6,4
9993,tyrion, m,tyrion, You’re right. Slavery is a horror that should be ended at once. War is a horror that should be ended at once. I can’t do both today.,4,6,27
9994,tyrion, m,tyrion, I don’t trust the Masters. I trust their self-interest. They’re trustworthy if they’re convinced that working with me is in their self-interest.,4,6,22
9995,tyrion, m,tyrion, They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast. Their contempt is their weakness. They’ll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage.,4,6,29
9996,varys, m,varys," Your Grace, Lady Sansa is your aunt by marriage.",10,3,9
9997,varys, m,varys, When did you come to this strange country?,10,3,8
9998,varys, m,varys, You were only a child.,10,3,5
9999,varys, m,varys," You've been a good influence on our mutual friend, you know. He used to drink from sundown to sunup, visit three brothels a night, gamble away his father's money. Now it's just the drinking.",10,3,34
10000,varys, m,varys, She is a sweet young thing. None of this is her fault.,10,3,12
10001,varys, m,varys," No, I expect not.",10,3,4
10002,varys, m,varys," We break bread with them, but that doesn't make us family. We've learned their language, but we'll never be their countrymen. If you let yourself believe that a foreign girl with no name could spend her life with the son of Tywin Lannister--",10,3,43
10003,varys, m,varys, You have one name. As do I. Here only the family name matters.,10,3,13
10004,varys, m,varys," Diamonds. I'd tell you to beware carrying so much wealth, but you know how to protect yourself. Get on one of those ships. Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr. You can buy a house with these diamonds, a very large house. Hire servants. Start a new life, a good life, far from here. The mysterious foreign beauty. You'll have suitors lining up.",10,3,63
10005,varys, m,varys," We are trying, my lord.",3,3,5
10006,varys, m,varys," Robb Stark and most of his bannermen are in Riverrun for the funeral of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully. In Stark's absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal, which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal, in practice if not in name.",3,3,41
10007,varys, m,varys," Oh, Lord Tyrion. Come in, come in.",4,3,7
10008,varys, m,varys," Oh, always in confidence.",4,3,4
10009,varys, m,varys," Oh, no. It's a wonderful time.",4,3,6
10010,varys, m,varys, End your life?,4,3,3
10011,varys, m,varys, Proof? Will there be a trial?,4,3,6
10012,varys, m,varys," I have no proof, only whispers. Before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut. Do you want to hear it still?",4,3,30
10013,varys, m,varys," As a boy, I travelled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities. One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse. I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some men used small boys. But what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjuror's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it. But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess. A symbolic revenge of sorts.",4,3,187
10014,varys, m,varys, You do not possess at the moment.,4,3,7
10015,varys, m,varys," But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found. Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose, he threw me out of his house to die. I resolved to live to spite him. I begged. I sold what parts of my body remained to me. I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse. Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber. Influence grows like a weed. I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special.",4,3,130
10016,varys, m,varys," Hello, my old friend. It's been a long time. I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time if you have the stomach for it.",4,3,29
10017,varys, m,varys, Is he very large?,4,3,4
10018,varys, m,varys, Extraordinary.,4,3,1
10019,varys, m,varys, We're talking about the same Podrick? The quiet boy in Lord Tyrion's service? Seems a bit simple?,4,3,17
10020,varys, m,varys, What did he do to them?,4,3,6
10021,varys, m,varys, So what did they say?,4,3,5
10022,varys, m,varys, Huh. Prodigies appear in the oddest of places. And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income?,4,3,18
10023,varys, m,varys," Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her. Sad, really. Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark?",4,3,35
10024,varys, m,varys, What makes you say so?,4,3,5
10025,varys, m,varys, Ah. You can read. Rare for a woman in your profession.,4,3,11
10026,varys, m,varys, Of course. I'm missing something obvious you're about to point out?,4,3,11
10027,varys, m,varys, Who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides Littlefinger? Could he be bringing one of his girls?,4,3,20
10028,varys, m,varys, How do you know?,4,3,4
10029,varys, m,varys, Prodigies in odd places indeed.,4,3,5
10030,varys, m,varys, My lady. I wanted to personally welcome you to King's Landing. The city has been made brighter by your presence.,4,3,20
10031,varys, m,varys," A little obvious, perhaps.",4,3,4
10032,varys, m,varys, Might I sit?,4,3,3
10033,varys, m,varys, You've taken an interest in Sansa Stark.,4,3,7
10034,varys, m,varys, Is she?,4,3,2
10035,varys, m,varys," She has, sadly. Well, forgive me for wasting your time, then. I thought we shared certain hopes for her well-being.",4,3,20
10036,varys, m,varys, I choose my allies carefully and my enemies more carefully still.,4,3,11
10037,varys, m,varys, Neither. A babe in the woods. I admired her father.,4,3,10
10038,varys, m,varys, I could not help Lord Stark. Perhaps I can help his daughter.,4,3,12
10039,varys, m,varys, You're not the only one who has taken an interest in her.,4,3,12
10040,varys, m,varys, Indeed. She'd make a lovely match for the right suitor.,4,3,10
10041,varys, m,varys," Littlefinger is not long for the capital. A confidant of mine has told me that when he goes, Sansa Stark goes with him.",4,3,23
10042,varys, m,varys," Littlefinger was born with no lands, no wealth, no armies. He has acquired the first two. How long before he has the army?",4,3,23
10043,varys, m,varys," Perhaps you'll laugh, but I know him better than most and this is the truth. Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros. If Robb Stark falls, Sansa Stark is the key to the North.",4,3,37
10044,varys, m,varys, Which seems such a shame. Why should a man with such a low reputation steal away such a lovely bride?,4,3,20
10045,varys, m,varys," Actually, I rather enjoy him. But he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes.",4,3,20
10046,varys, m,varys, You are too kind. I believe I have a possible solution.,4,3,11
10047,varys, m,varys," 1000 blades taken from the hands of Aegon's fallen enemies, forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread.",6,3,19
10048,varys, m,varys," Ha, I'm sure you have. Ugly old thing. Yet it has a certain appeal. The Lysa Arryn of chairs. Shame you had to settle for your second choice.",6,3,28
10049,varys, m,varys," Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you. Although who doesn't like to see their friends fail now and then?",6,3,23
10050,varys, m,varys, I did what I did for the good of the realm.,6,3,11
10051,varys, m,varys, But what do we have left once we abandon the lie? Chaos. A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.,6,3,20
10052,varys, m,varys," What have you done? Quickly. Trust me, my friend, I’ve brought you this far.",10,4,14
10053,varys, m,varys, I'm afraid foreigners aren't welcome at such exclusive affairs.,2,4,9
10054,varys, m,varys, Ahem.,2,4,1
10055,varys, m,varys, Shae has been noticed. Sansa's maid saw you with her. She already told your sister. It's only a matter of time before your father hears.,2,4,25
10056,varys, m,varys," No, I will not. How long do you imagine your father and sister would let me live if they suspected me of lying? I have no pet sellsword to protect me. No legendary brother to avenge me. Only little birds who whisper in my ear.",2,4,45
10057,varys, m,varys, No one weeps for spiders or whores. I have friends across the sea who could help her.,2,4,17
10058,varys, m,varys, Your father has promised to hang the next whore he finds you with. Have you ever known your father to make an idle threat?,2,4,24
10059,varys, m,varys, Your Grace.,5,4,2
10060,varys, m,varys," Sandor Clegane has been spotted in the Riverlands, my lord.",6,4,10
10061,varys, m,varys," My birds tell me the Hound slaughtered five of our soldiers. I believe the phrase ""fuck the king"" was uttered.",6,4,20
10062,varys, m,varys, 10 silver stags seems a generous bounty.,6,4,7
10063,varys, m,varys," More whispers from the east, my lord.",6,4,7
10064,varys, m,varys, Daenerys has taken up residence in Meereen. She has conquered the city and rules as its queen.,6,4,17
10065,varys, m,varys," No longer. He appears to be fully devoted to her. As for Ser Barristan, it would seem he took his dismissal from the Kingsguard a bit harder than anticipated.",6,4,29
10066,varys, m,varys," A child with two seasoned warriors counseling her and a powerful army at her back, Your Grace.",6,4,17
10067,varys, m,varys," Most certainly, my Lord Hand.",6,4,5
10068,varys, m,varys, Prince Oberyn.,6,4,2
10069,varys, m,varys, Only Varys. I'm not actually a nobleman. No one is under obligation to call me lord.,6,4,16
10070,varys, m,varys, You seem quite knowledgeable about the Unsullied. Did you spend much time in Essos?,6,4,14
10071,varys, m,varys, May I ask why?,6,4,4
10072,varys, m,varys, Most of us aren't princes.,6,4,5
10073,varys, m,varys, I have an ear for accents. I've lost my accent entirely.,6,4,11
10074,varys, m,varys, It's a long story.,6,4,4
10075,varys, m,varys, People I trust.,6,4,3
10076,varys, m,varys, (shakes his head),6,4,3
10077,varys, m,varys," Not at all. But I was never interested in girls, either.",6,4,11
10078,varys, m,varys,  Nothing.,6,4,1
10079,varys, m,varys," Not me. When I see what desire does to people, what it's done to this country, I am very glad to have no part in it. Besides, the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things.",6,4,38
10080,varys, m,varys," I'm afraid I do, my lord. He said, ""Perhaps you should speak more softly to me, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies.""",6,4,28
10081,varys, m,varys, Yes. After we received word of Robb Stark's death. He didn't seem gladdened by the news. Perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause.,6,4,31
10082,varys, m,varys," Sadly, my lord, I never forget a thing.",6,4,8
10083,varys, m,varys, I thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me.,10,5,11
10084,varys, m,varys," The birds sing in the west, the birds sing in the east. If one knows how to listen. They tell me you’ve already found favor with the Mother of Dragons.",10,5,30
10085,varys, m,varys, Information is the key. You need to learn your enemies’ strengths and strategies. You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends.,10,5,25
10086,varys, m,varys," If only. (beat) A grand old city, choking on violence, corruption, and deceit. Who could possibly have any experience managing such a massive, ungainly beast?",10,5,25
10087,varys, m,varys," Oh, I know.",10,5,3
10088,varys, m,varys, Volantis is a large city.,3,5,5
10089,varys, m,varys, The likelihood of you being spotted here increases a hundredfold.,3,5,10
10090,varys, m,varys, I'm not sure how many new ways I can find of saying this.,3,5,13
10091,varys, m,varys, It's a perfectly good face.,3,5,5
10092,varys, m,varys," If anyone recognizes you, you'll lose more than that.",3,5,9
10093,varys, m,varys, Yes. The Volantene masters are very organized. (Shot of a man with a fly tattooed onto his cheek). Flies for dung shovelers. (Shot of a man with a hammer tattooed onto his cheek). Hammers for builders. (Shot of a man inspecting women with tears tattooed onto their cheeks). Tears for whores. Lest they forget.,3,5,54
10094,varys, m,varys, (Aside) We should keep moving.,3,5,5
10095,varys, m,varys, Thank you.,3,5,2
10096,varys, m,varys, Someone who inspires priests and whores is worth taking seriously.,3,5,10
10097,varys, m,varys, Where're you going?,3,5,3
10098,varys, m,varys," Yes, best be careful. You might accidentally consume some solid food.",2,5,11
10099,varys, m,varys, You don't like it?,2,5,4
10100,varys, m,varys, You can't. Cersei has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head.,2,5,15
10101,varys, m,varys, Are we really going to spend the entire road to Volantis talking about the futility of everything?,2,5,17
10102,varys, m,varys, The road to Meereen.,2,5,4
10103,varys, m,varys, I told you. A ruler.,2,5,5
10104,varys, m,varys," You were quite good, you know. At ruling. During your brief tenure as Hand.",2,5,14
10105,varys, m,varys," Still, a man of talent.",2,5,5
10106,varys, m,varys," Yes, but showed great promise in other areas as well.",2,5,10
10107,varys, m,varys, Why?,2,5,1
10108,varys, m,varys, People follow leaders. And they will never follow us. They find us repulsive.,2,5,13
10109,varys, m,varys," And we find them repulsive, which is why we surround ourselves with large, comfortable boxes to keep them away. And yet, no matter what we do, people like you and me are never really satisfied inside the box. Not for long.",2,5,41
10110,varys, m,varys, No.,2,5,1
10111,varys, m,varys, Apologies.,1,5,1
10112,varys, m,varys," I saved your life. If they catch you, they catch me. I cannot say I feel overly guilty about leaving you in that “fucking crate”.",1,5,25
10113,varys, m,varys, No. I only know what it’s like to pick up your shit and throw it overboard.,1,5,16
10114,varys, m,varys," The home of my colleague. Ilyrio Mopatis. A merchant. He and I met many years ago, through mutual friends. A group of people who saw Robert Baratheon for the disaster he was. We tried to do what was best for the realm by supporting the Targaryen restoration. And thus began the chain of mistakes that has led us both here. Things have gotten worse, not better. Westeros needs to be saved from itself.",1,5,73
10115,varys, m,varys, My lord?,1,5,2
10116,varys, m,varys, You already drank yourself across the Narrow Sea.,1,5,8
10117,varys, m,varys, Because we are talking about the future of our country.,1,5,10
10118,varys, m,varys," Imp, half-man.",1,5,2
10119,varys, m,varys, There are faster ways to kill yourself.,1,5,7
10120,varys, m,varys," You are many things, my friend, but not a coward.",1,5,10
10121,varys, m,varys, Your brother asked me to.,1,5,5
10122,varys, m,varys, Refuse the Kingslayer? A dangerous proposition.,1,5,6
10123,varys, m,varys, I didn’t do it for you. I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.,1,5,13
10124,varys, m,varys, I don’t believe in saviors. I believe men of talent have a role to play in the war to come.,1,5,20
10125,varys, m,varys," You have many admirable qualities, self-pity is not one of them. Any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power. But earning it for yourself, that takes work.",1,5,32
10126,varys, m,varys," I think you are. You have your father’s instinct for politics, and you have compassion.",1,5,15
10127,varys, m,varys, I never said you were perfect.,1,5,6
10128,varys, m,varys, Peace. Prosperity. A land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless.,1,5,13
10129,varys, m,varys," Perhaps. And perhaps we’ve grown so used to horror we assume there’s no other way. If you sat on the Iron Throne, would you spread misery throughout the land?",1,5,29
10130,varys, m,varys," No, you won’t. But you could help another climb those steps and take that seat. The Seven Kingdoms need someone stronger than Tommen, but gentler than Stannis. A monarch who can intimidate the high lord and inspire the people. A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name.",1,5,53
10131,varys, m,varys," Who said anything about him? You have a choice my friend. You can stay here at Ilyrio’s palace and drink yourself to death, or you can ride with me to Mereen, meet Daenerys Targaryen, and decide if the world is worth fighting for.",1,5,43
10132,varys, m,varys," I've always hated the bells. They ring for horror. A dead king, a city under siege.",9,2,16
10133,varys, m,varys," Exactly. Podrick, is that it?",9,2,5
10134,varys, m,varys, I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting.,9,2,7
10135,varys, m,varys, Do you trust him?,9,2,4
10136,varys, m,varys, Good.,9,2,1
10137,varys, m,varys, The map you asked for.,9,2,5
10138,varys, m,varys, Closer to 50. The Targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and to provide escape if necessary.,9,2,18
10139,varys, m,varys," That is good to hear. Though I'm sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat. You look well suited for battle, my lord.",9,2,26
10140,varys, m,varys," For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong. My little birds tell me that Stannis Baratheon has taken up with a red priestess from Asshai.",9,2,26
10141,varys, m,varys," You don't believe in the old powers, my lord?",9,2,9
10142,varys, m,varys, I think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen. You probably don't entirely trust me.,9,2,22
10143,varys, m,varys," And yet I have seen things and heard things, things you have not, things I wish I had not. I don't believe I've ever told you how I was cut.",9,2,30
10144,varys, m,varys," One day, I will. The dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his armies and paved his path to our door. For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne, I can think of nothing worse. And tonight, I believe you are the only man who can stop him.",9,2,54
10145,varys, m,varys, My Lord Hand. Commander. I must compliment you on the gold cloaks' performance these last few weeks. Did you know there has been a marked drop in thievery?,8,2,28
10146,varys, m,varys," Given the circumstances, my lord, I believe extreme measures are warranted.",8,2,11
10147,varys, m,varys," Ah. ""The Great Sieges of Westeros."" Thrilling subject. Shame Archmaester Ch'Vyalthan wasn't a better writer.",8,2,15
10148,varys, m,varys," And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate, what is our plan?",8,2,12
10149,varys, m,varys, We don't have that many books.,8,2,6
10150,varys, m,varys, What do we have?,8,2,4
10151,varys, m,varys," No man can be in all rooms at all times. I have many little birds in the North, my lord, but I haven't heard their songs since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell.",8,2,31
10152,varys, m,varys, I am trying.,8,2,3
10153,varys, m,varys," Oh, no one disputes that, my lord, not even the multitudes who despise you.",8,2,14
10154,varys, m,varys," I wish we could, too.",8,2,5
10155,varys, m,varys," If we're going to play, you'll have to start.",8,2,9
10156,varys, m,varys, A most highborn plumber.,8,2,4
10157,varys, m,varys, And you play it well.,8,2,5
10158,varys, m,varys, They say he burns his enemies alive to honor the Lord of Light.,8,2,13
10159,varys, m,varys," In the Summer Isles, they worship a fertility goddess with 16 teats.",8,2,12
10160,varys, m,varys," This morning, I heard a song all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste. Daenerys Targaryen lives.",8,2,18
10161,varys, m,varys," She has three dragons. But even if what they say is true, it'll be years before they are fully grown. And then there will be nowhere to hide.",8,2,28
10162,varys, m,varys," No need for that, my dear.",10,2,6
10163,varys, m,varys, I'm not like most men.,10,2,5
10164,varys, m,varys, (laughs),10,2,1
10165,varys, m,varys, I would like you to tell me if working for Lord Baelish has been all you'd hoped it would be.,10,2,20
10166,varys, m,varys, You wouldn't remember me if we had?,10,2,7
10167,varys, m,varys, And I think you remember all of them. I think your true talents are wasted on them.,10,2,17
10168,varys, m,varys, You're afraid. Why? Nothing dangerous down there.,10,2,7
10169,varys, m,varys," And, unlike your current employer, I protect those who work for me. I don't abuse them to satisfy royal whims or force them to abuse each other.",10,2,27
10170,varys, m,varys,  I thought you said you knew who I was.,10,2,9
10171,varys, m,varys, Littlefinger looks at you and sees a collection of profitable holes. I see a potential partner.,10,2,16
10172,varys, m,varys," Oh, you should be. He's a dangerous man. But everyone has their weaknesses. Your current employer hides his very well, but not as well as he thinks.",10,2,27
10173,varys, m,varys, Why would I lie about it?,10,2,6
10174,varys, m,varys," Where before there was nothing but love. Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill you on your sister's orders. If it weren't for your squire's bravery, you'd be a dead man.",10,2,30
10175,varys, m,varys, I'm afraid your friend has been relieved of his command of the City Watch. The gold cloaks are now firmly in the hands of your father or your sister. It varies from cloak to cloak.,10,2,35
10176,varys, m,varys," Have gone home. Your father paid them quite handsomely. I'm afraid we won't be seeing each other for some time, my lord.",10,2,22
10177,varys, m,varys," We are. Podrick, would you mind?",10,2,6
10178,varys, m,varys," There are many who know that without you this city faced certain defeat. The king won't give you any honors, the histories won't mention you, but we will not forget.",10,2,30
10179,varys, m,varys," Come along now, Podrick.",10,2,4
10180,varys, m,varys," Ooh. ""The Queen mustn't know."" I love conversations that begin this way.",3,2,12
10181,varys, m,varys," Theon Greyjoy? Forgive me, my lord, but how? He grew up a ward of Winterfell. He fights for Robb Stark.",3,2,20
10182,varys, m,varys, You'll be pleased to know our mutual friend is doing quite well in Lady Sansa's service.,3,2,16
10183,varys, m,varys," And it seems the Grand Maester has found his way into a black cell? Well played, My Lord Hand. But should I be worried? Janos Slynt, Pycelle. The Small Council grows smaller every day.",3,2,34
10184,varys, m,varys," Power is a curious thing, my lord. Are you fond of riddles?",3,2,12
10185,varys, m,varys," Three great men sit in a room. A king, a priest and a rich man. Between them stands a common sellsword. Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two. Who lives, who dies?",3,2,35
10186,varys, m,varys, Does it? He has neither crown nor gold nor favor with the gods.,3,2,13
10187,varys, m,varys," But if it's swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible? Joffrey? The executioner? Or something else?",3,2,31
10188,varys, m,varys," Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the wall. And a very small man can cast a very large shadow.",3,2,26
10189,varys, m,varys, Your father has named Lord Tyrion to (Cersei scoffs) serve as hand in his stead.,2,2,15
10190,varys, m,varys, My lord.,2,2,2
10191,varys, m,varys, We were just speaking of your bravery in the victory against the Stark auxiliary forces.,2,2,15
10192,varys, m,varys, I heard you suffered a terrible head wound. The northerners are such fearsome warriors.,2,2,14
10193,varys, m,varys, To find so lovely creature working in your father's kitchen. It almost beggars belief.,2,2,14
10194,varys, m,varys, How can you tell?,2,2,4
10195,varys, m,varys," I am glad your new friend was able to accompany you to the capital. Friends are such an important part of life. Unfortunate that your father didn't want her to come. But rest easy my lord, I am very good at keeping secrets for my good friends.",2,2,47
10196,varys, m,varys," How unspeakable of me to go on and on, when all you want to do is rest. I will leave you. (Kisses Shae’s hand). Welcome to Kings Landing, my dear. The city is made brighter by your presence. We have a council meeting, my lord.",2,2,45
10197,varys, m,varys, Who threatened you?,2,2,3
10198,varys, m,varys, Ned Stark was a man of honor.,2,2,7
10199,varys, m,varys," You might be disappointed in the results. The storms come and go. The big fish eat the little fish. And I keep on paddling. Come, my lord. We shouldn't keep the queen waiting.",2,2,33
10200,varys, m,varys, Trouble with the wildlings?,2,2,4
10201,varys, m,varys, Somewhat less wild these days. It seems they've stopped killing each other and started following this King-Beyond-the-Wall.,2,2,17
10202,varys, m,varys, How do you kill a dead man?,2,2,7
10203,varys, m,varys," The peasants say, a long summer means an even longer winter.",1,2,11
10204,varys, m,varys, Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as Hand in his stead while he fights -,1,2,17
10205,varys, m,varys,  I wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests.  You begged us to summon the King in the North.  Don't you want to see him again?,3,7,27
10206,varys, m,varys,  Strange.  You spoke so highly of Jon Snow but when he arrives you hide on a cliff.  I didn't take you for a bashful girl.,3,7,25
10207,varys, m,varys,"  Oh, I doubt that.  Give us common folk one taste of power we're like the lion who tasted man.  Nothing is ever so sweet again.",3,7,25
10208,varys, m,varys,  Why?,3,7,1
10209,varys, m,varys,  So where will you go?,3,7,5
10210,varys, m,varys,"  Good.  If you don't mind my saying, I don't think you should return to Westeros.  I'm not sure you'd be safe here.",3,7,22
10211,varys, m,varys,  My Lady --,3,7,3
10212,varys, m,varys,  Our Iron Born and Dornish allies were attacked on route to Dorne.,3,7,12
10213,varys, m,varys,  Two or three ships escaped.  The rest sunk our captured.  Ellaria and the sand snakes dead or captured.  The Greyjoys are dead or captured.,3,7,24
10214,varys, m,varys,"  Your Grace, he's already destroyed a good portion of our fleet.  To send our remaining ships after him --",3,7,19
10215,varys, m,varys,  The Unsullied will be there soon.,3,7,6
10216,varys, m,varys,  A difficult situation.  They know we're coming.,3,7,7
10217,varys, m,varys, I remember that storm. All the dogs in King's Landing howled through the night.,2,7,14
10218,varys, m,varys," Cersei controls fewer than half the Seven Kingdoms. The lord of Westeros despise her. Even before your arrival, they plotted against her. Now...",2,7,23
10219,varys, m,varys," They joined our side, my queen, because they believe in you.",2,7,11
10220,varys, m,varys, I did.,2,7,2
10221,varys, m,varys," I had a choice, Your Grace--serve Robert Baratheon or face the headman's axe.",2,7,13
10222,varys, m,varys," Robert was an improvement on your father, to be sure. There have been few rulers in history as cruel as the Mad King. Robert was neither mad nor cruel. He simply had no interest in being king.",2,7,37
10223,varys, m,varys," Until your marriage to Khal Drogo, Your Grace, I knew nothing about you, save your existence and that you were said to be beautiful.",2,7,24
10224,varys, m,varys, Which you turned to your advantage.,2,7,6
10225,varys, m,varys, King Robert.,2,7,2
10226,varys, m,varys," Your Grace, I did what had to be done to--",2,7,10
10227,varys, m,varys," The kind the realm needs. Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty. As long as I have my eyes, I'll use them. I wasn't born into a great house. I came from nothing. I was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering. When I was a child, I lived in alleys, gutters, abandoned houses. You wish to know where my true loyalties lie? Not with any king or queen, but with the people. The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule. The people whose hearts you aim to win. If you demand blind allegiance, I respect your wishes. Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me. But if you let me live, I will serve you well. I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne because I choose you. Because I know the people have no better chance than you.",2,7,153
10228,varys, m,varys," I swear it, my queen.",2,7,5
10229,varys, m,varys, I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons.,2,7,10
10230,varys, m,varys,"  She once served another who wanted the Iron Throne.  It didn't end well for Stannis Baratheon, did it?",2,7,18
10231,varys, m,varys,"  And why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow aside from the visions you've seen in the flames, that is?",2,7,25
10232,varys, m,varys,  Not burn him alive alongside his son.,5,7,7
10233,varys, m,varys,  That's what I used to tell myself about her father.  I found the traitors but I wasn't the one burning them alive.  I was only a purveyor of information.,5,7,29
10234,varys, m,varys,"  It's what I told myself when I watched them beg for mercy, ""I'm not the one doing it.""  As the pitch of their screams rose higher, ""I'm not the one doing it.""  When their hair caught fire and the smell of the burning flesh filled the Thone Room, ""I'm not the one doing it.""",5,7,54
10235,varys, m,varys,  And she never will be... with the right counsel.  You need to find a way to make her listen.,5,7,19
10236,varys, m,varys,  Jon Snow.,5,7,2
10237,varys, m,varys,  It's a sealed scroll for the King in the North.,5,7,10
10238,varys, m,varys,  Nothing good.,5,7,2
10239,varys, m,varys,  The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years.  Presumably --,5,7,12
10240,varys, m,varys,  Anything you bring back will be useless unless Cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the moment we set foot in the capital.,5,7,29
10241,varys, m,varys,  Fair point.  How do you propose to find one?,5,7,9
10242,varys, m,varys," And that would be double what now, exactly?",7,7,8
10243,varys, m,varys," You take great offense at dwarf jokes, but love telling eunuch jokes. Why is that?",1,8,15
10244,varys, m,varys, The Karstarks.,1,8,2
10245,varys, m,varys, You overestimate our influence. Jon and Daenerys don't want to listen to lonely old men.,1,8,15
10246,varys, m,varys," Of course she does. Respect is how the young keep us at a distance, so we don't remind them of an unpleasant truth.",1,8,23
10247,varys, m,varys, Nothing lasts.,1,8,2
10248,varys, m,varys," And the Golden Company has arrived in King's Landing, courtesy of the Greyjoy fleet. The balance has grown distressingly even.",4,8,20
10249,varys, m,varys," Thankfully, she's losing allies by the day. Yara Greyjoy has retaken the Iron Islands in her queen's name. The new Prince of Dorne pledges his support.",4,8,26
10250,varys, m,varys, How many others know?,4,8,4
10251,varys, m,varys," Well, then it's not a secret anymore. It's information. If a handful of people know now, hundreds will know soon. Then what happens?",4,8,23
10252,varys, m,varys," No, it's worse than that. He has the better claim to the throne.",4,8,13
10253,varys, m,varys," I'm not sure it matters what he wants. The fact is, people are drawn to him. Wildlings, Northmen. He's a war hero.",4,8,22
10254,varys, m,varys, She's his aunt.,4,8,3
10255,varys, m,varys," No, but Jon grew up in Winterfell. Is marrying your aunt common in the North? You know our queen better than I do. Do you think she wants to share the throne? She does not like to have her authority questioned.",4,8,41
10256,varys, m,varys, I worry about her state of mind.,4,8,7
10257,varys, m,varys, Your Grace. I promised you I would look you in the eye and speak directly if I ever thought you were making a mistake. This is a mistake.,4,8,28
10258,varys, m,varys, (nods),4,8,1
10259,varys, m,varys," Cersei needs to be destroyed, but if we attack King's Landing with Drogon and the Unsullied and the Dothraki, tens of thousands of innocents will die. That is why Cersei is bringing them into the Red Keep. These are the people you came here to protect. I beg you, Your Grace. Do not destroy the city you came to save. Do not become what you have always struggled to defeat.",4,8,70
10260,varys, m,varys,  I've served tyrants most of my life. They all talk about destiny.,4,8,12
10261,varys, m,varys, Perhaps that's the problem. Her life has convinced her that she was sent here to save us all.,4,8,18
10262,varys, m,varys," Then there's the problem of Jon Snow. Perhaps it's actually a solution. You know them both. Tell me, who do you think would make a better ruler?",4,8,27
10263,varys, m,varys, Have you considered the best ruler might be someone who doesn't want to rule?,4,8,14
10264,varys, m,varys, Don't pretend you haven't thought about it.,4,8,7
10265,varys, m,varys," He's temperate and measured. He's a man, which makes him more appealing to the lords of Westeros, whose support we are going to need.",4,8,24
10266,varys, m,varys," And he's the heir to the throne. Yes, because he's a man. Cocks are important, I'm afraid.",4,8,17
10267,varys, m,varys," She's too strong for him. She'd bend him to her will, as she already has.",4,8,15
10268,varys, m,varys, As you have? You're drinking quite a lot. A Targaryen father and a Stark mother. Jon's the one man alive who might actually be able to keep the North in the Seven Kingdoms.,4,8,33
10269,varys, m,varys, You've always known my reasons.,4,8,5
10270,varys, m,varys, Even if you know it's a mistake?,4,8,7
10271,varys, m,varys, You know where my loyalty stands. You know I will never betray the realm.,4,8,14
10272,varys, m,varys," Millions of people, many of whom will die if the wrong person sits on that throne. We don't know their names, but they're just as real as you and I. They deserve to live. They deserve food for their children. I will act in their interest, no matter the personal cost.",4,8,51
10273,varys, m,varys, I've spoken as honestly as I can. Each of us has a choice to make. I pray we choose wisely.,4,8,20
10274,varys, m,varys,"  You've seen better days, my lord.",9,1,6
10275,varys, m,varys,"  No, no, many still love you. Sansa came to court this morning to plead for your life.",9,1,17
10276,varys, m,varys,"  You do me wrong, my lord. Your blood is the last thing l want.",9,1,14
10277,varys, m,varys,"  l could. But will l? No. As l said, I'm no hero.",9,1,12
10278,varys, m,varys,  Peace. Did you know that your son is marching south with an army of Northmen? Loyal lad. Fighting for his father's freedom.,9,1,22
10279,varys, m,varys,  Boys have been conquerors before. But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights is the king's the late king's brother. Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne. He is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy.,9,1,40
10280,varys, m,varys,  Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life. lt would be a shame to throw it away. Cersei is no fool. She knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one.,9,1,34
10281,varys, m,varys,"  l want you to serve the realm! Tell the queen you will confess your vile treason, tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir. Cersei knows you as a man of honor. lf you give her the peace she needs, and promise to carry her secret to your grave, l believe she will allow you to take the black and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son.",9,1,81
10282,varys, m,varys,"  Pity. Such a pity. What of your daughter's life, my lord? ls that a precious thing to you?",9,1,18
10283,varys, m,varys,"  When you imagine yourself up there, how do you look? Does the crown fit? Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow, the ones who sneered at you for years?",10,1,31
10284,varys, m,varys,  A man with great ambition and no morals… l wouldn't bet against you.,10,1,13
10285,varys, m,varys,  l must be one of the few men in this city who doesn't want to be King.,10,1,17
10286,varys, m,varys,"  Oh, you can do better than that.",10,1,7
10287,varys, m,varys,  Have you? Do you spend a lot of time wondering what's between my legs?,10,1,14
10288,varys, m,varys,"  l am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all.",10,1,10
10289,varys, m,varys,  Am l? That is good to know. Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash?,10,1,16
10290,varys, m,varys,"  And l admire you, Lord Baelish. A grasper from a minor House with a major talent for befriending powerful men – and women.",10,1,23
10291,varys, m,varys,  So here we stand in mutual admiration and respect.,10,1,9
10292,varys, m,varys,"  (Joffrey arrives, Varys bows)  Serving a new King.",10,1,8
10293,varys, m,varys,  My king.,10,1,2
10294,varys, m,varys, Lord Stark.,3,1,2
10295,varys, m,varys, I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad. We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.,3,1,21
10296,varys, m,varys, His Grace has many cares. He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.,3,1,18
10297,varys, m,varys," You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure.",3,1,12
10298,varys, m,varys,  Lady Stark.,3,1,2
10299,varys, m,varys,  To see you again after so many years is a blessing. Your poor hands.,3,1,14
10300,varys, m,varys,"  Knowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel.",3,1,34
10301,varys, m,varys,  I must admit I do not.,3,1,6
10302,varys, m,varys," How is your son, my Lord?",5,1,6
10303,varys, m,varys, But his mind is sound?,5,1,5
10304,varys, m,varys,A blessing then. I suffered an early mutilation myself. Some doors close forever... others open in the most unexpected places. May I?,5,1,22
10305,varys, m,varys," If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head. And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders. But there are things you must know. You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool... your friend, I know, but a fool... and doomed unless you save him.",5,1,62
10306,varys, m,varys, I didn't trust you.,5,1,4
10307,varys, m,varys," The Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely. There are few men of honor in the capital. You are one of them. I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem.",5,1,40
10308,varys, m,varys," The same sort as Jon Arryn. The tears of Lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water. It leaves no trace.",5,1,28
10309,varys, m,varys," Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one? There were many. Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man. There was one boy... all he was he owed to Jon Arryn.",5,1,31
10310,varys, m,varys," Pity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely.",5,1,15
10311,varys, m,varys, Someone who could afford it.,5,1,5
10312,varys, m,varys, He started asking questions.,5,1,4
10313,varys, m,varys, He's found one bastard already. He has the book. The rest will come.,5,1,13
10314,varys, m,varys," The gods alone know. The fools tried to kill his son. What's worse, they botched it. The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats. We will be at war soon, my friend.",5,1,35
10315,varys, m,varys, This Hand is not the other.,5,1,6
10316,varys, m,varys," ""Delay,"" you say. ""Move fast, "" I reply. This is no longer a game for two players.",5,1,17
10317,varys, m,varys, The first to arrive and the last to leave. I admire your industry.,5,1,13
10318,varys, m,varys, We all have our qualities.,5,1,5
10319,varys, m,varys, I think you're mistaking business with pleasure.,5,1,7
10320,varys, m,varys," Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear.",5,1,12
10321,varys, m,varys," Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?",5,1,19
10322,varys, m,varys, And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers. Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination. The logistics alone... to find beautiful corpses before they rot.,5,1,35
10323,varys, m,varys, Strictly speaking.,5,1,2
10324,varys, m,varys," Do you know, I have no idea where they are? And we had been so close. But enough about me. How have you been since we last saw each other?",5,1,30
10325,varys, m,varys," Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King.",5,1,16
10326,varys, m,varys, Eyes I own.,5,1,3
10327,varys, m,varys, Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife. If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion... To think... A simple word to the Queen...,5,1,44
10328,varys, m,varys, Oh.,5,1,1
10329,varys, m,varys, Have you?,5,1,2
10330,varys, m,varys, Was that you under the bed?,5,1,6
10331,varys, m,varys," Oh, please.",5,1,2
10332,varys, m,varys, Disturbing news from far away. Haven't you heard?,5,1,8
10333,varys, m,varys," No rumor, my Lord. The princess is with child.",5,1,9
10334,varys, m,varys, Ser Jorah Mormont. He is serving as adviser to the Targaryens.,5,1,11
10335,varys, m,varys," I understand your misgivings, my Lord. Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing. Yet, we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm. Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed.",5,1,48
10336,varys, m,varys, Dreadful.,4,1,1
10337,varys, m,varys," The realm prospers from such events, my Lord. They give the great a chance at glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes.",4,1,24
10338,varys, m,varys, Would you?,8,6,2
10339,varys, m,varys, You made a pact with fanatics.,8,6,6
10340,varys, m,varys," If you shaved your beard with a straight razor, you’d say the razor worked. That doesn’t mean it won’t cut your throat.",8,6,22
10341,varys, m,varys, I know.,8,6,2
10342,varys, m,varys," If I don’t return, you’ll know I was wrong.",8,6,9
10343,varys, m,varys,We need friends in Westeros. And we need ships.,8,6,9
10344,varys, m,varys, She’ll come back. She has to. My heart’s been broken too many times already.,8,6,14
10345,varys, m,varys, I’ll walk the rest of the way myself. I can’t go off on a secret mission in the company of the most famous dwarf in the city.,8,6,27
10346,varys, m,varys, Fire and blood.,10,6,3
10347,varys, m,varys, I don’t know how you stand it in all that leather.,3,6,11
10348,varys, m,varys, If we could have the room.,3,6,6
10349,varys, m,varys," You look lovely today, my dear. You really do. How you climbed all those steps without breaking a sweat.",3,6,19
10350,varys, m,varys, I am not a torturer.,3,6,5
10351,varys, m,varys, Though it so often is what people deserve.,3,6,8
10352,varys, m,varys," And it does provide answers. But they’re usually the wrong answers. My job is to find the right answers. Do you know how I do that? I do it by making people happy. I’d like to make you happy, Vala. That’s your name, isn’t it, Vala?",3,6,46
10353,varys, m,varys," That’s all right. I know who you are and what you’ve done. You’ve done a lot. You’ve sacrificed your body for a cause, which is more than most people do. And you’ve helped the Sons of the Harpy murder the Unsullied and the Second Sons.",3,6,45
10354,varys, m,varys," Children are blameless. I have never hurt them. Your boy is in no immediate danger, this I swear to you. But between us, dear, you did conspire to kill the queen’s soldiers. We both know the penalty for that crime. How will poor Dom get on without his mother? And with his breathing problem.",3,6,54
10355,varys, m,varys," Yes, from your perspective, this is a problem. There is a third option, though. A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos. I’ve already booked passage for a woman and her young son. I’ll even throw in a bag of silver to help you start again.",3,6,44
10356,varys, m,varys, Though I’m afraid we’ll have to ask one of our leather-clad friends back in to carry it. Far too heavy for me. The boat sails at dawn. You need to decide now. A new life for you and Dom or…,3,6,40
10357,varys, m,varys, Sorry. I was busy learning who funds the Sons of the Harpy. Some things you can’t rush.,3,6,17
10358,varys, m,varys, The good masters of Astapor. And the wise masters of Yunkai. With help from their friends in Volantis.,3,6,18
10359,varys, m,varys," Of course. Man can be fickle, but birds always trust.",3,6,10
10360,varys, m,varys, I do not make dwarf jokes.,2,6,6
10361,varys, m,varys," So, the fleet. It’s been burned.",2,6,6
10362,varys, m,varys, Astapor and Yunkai have stopped asking us for aid.,2,6,9
10363,varys, m,varys," The Masters have retaken both cities. Outside of Meereen, the whole of Slaver’s Bay has returned to the slavers.",2,6,19
10364,varys, m,varys, Do they know that?,2,6,4
10365,varys, m,varys, You walk like a rich person.,1,6,6
10366,varys, m,varys, You walk as though the paving stones were your personal property. I used to steal from people like you when I was a boy.,1,6,24
10367,varys, m,varys, She thinks you want to eat her baby.,1,6,8
10368,varys, m,varys," His Valyrian is terrible. He only wants to give you money, so your baby can eat.",1,6,16
10369,varys, m,varys, Mhysa means mother in Valyrian.,1,6,5
10370,varys, m,varys, Who wrote it?,1,6,3
10371,varys, m,varys, The Sons of the Harpy?,1,6,5
10372,varys, m,varys, She did fly away on a dragon and not come back.,1,6,11
10373,varys, m,varys," The Sons of the Harpy planned their attack in the fighting pits very carefully, which means they take orders from someone.",1,6,21
10374,varys, m,varys," My little birds have already taken wing. Soon they’ll return, singing songs of men in gold masks.",1,6,17
10375,varys, m,varys," In the last fortnight since our pact with the Masters, how many killings have been carried out by the Sons of the Harpy?",5,6,23
10376,varys, m,varys, And how many Masters have been butchered by the free men.,5,6,11
10377,varys, m,varys, So it’s safe to say that a fragile peace has taken hold.,5,6,12
10378,varys, m,varys, For now is the best we get in our profession.,5,6,10
10379,varys, m,varys," Considering the city was on the brink of civil war, I’d say it’s a good start.",5,6,16
10380,varys, m,varys, Sounds like quite the hero. Where would we find him?,5,6,10
10381,varys, m,varys," A man named Stannis Baratheon was anointed as the chosen one by one of your priestesses. He, too, had a glorious destiny. He attacked King’s Landing and was soundly defeated by the man standing beside me. Last I had heard, he’d been defeated again, this time at Winterfell and this time for good.",5,6,53
10382,varys, m,varys, I suppose it’s hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake. Isn’t that the whole point of being a fanatic? You’re always right. Everything is the Lord’s will.,5,6,28
10383,varys, m,varys," And you, an honest servant of the lord, why should I trust you to know any more than the priestess who counseled Stannis?",5,6,23
10384,melisandre, f,melisandre, Show the boy to his chambers. Have the maids draw him a bath and find him some decent clothes. I'll come visit you soon.,8,3,24
10385,melisandre, f,melisandre,  You know what I mean to do with him.,8,3,9
10386,melisandre, f,melisandre," Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king?",8,3,8
10387,melisandre, f,melisandre," If the lamb sees the knife, she panics. Her panic seeps into her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavor.",8,3,19
10388,melisandre, f,melisandre,  And none have seen the blade.,8,3,6
10389,melisandre, f,melisandre, Have you ever seen one like it?,8,3,7
10390,melisandre, f,melisandre," It's shocking, isn't it, the first time you encounter real wealth?  When I was your age, I lived on one bowl of stew a day. And stew is a kind word for it.",8,3,33
10391,melisandre, f,melisandre," Here, taste this.",8,3,3
10392,melisandre, f,melisandre, You think I'm trying to poison you?,8,3,7
10393,melisandre, f,melisandre, Where do you think it's from?,8,3,6
10394,melisandre, f,melisandre," Doesn't matter, does it?  It's the real thing or it's not. You only need a tongue to tell the difference. Go on, have some more. You still don't trust it. You think this is all a mistake and that you'll have to pay somehow for every bite you take.",8,3,49
10395,melisandre, f,melisandre, There are no mistakes. Not for us.,8,3,7
10396,melisandre, f,melisandre," Your father chose your mother because the Lord of Light willed it. He willed it so you could be here right now with a power inside you you can't even begin to understand. And He brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world. We're both a part of His plan. He wants this for us. No, He demands this of us.",8,3,67
10397,melisandre, f,melisandre," According to whom?  The Silent Sisters? With their stern looks, muzzled mouths, and dried-up cunts? What have their gods done for you?  Hmm?  When you pray to them, what's their answer?  A god is real or he's not. You only need eyes to see.",8,3,44
10398,melisandre, f,melisandre," Death is coming for everyone and everything. A darkness that will swallow the dawn. And we can stop it, you and I.",8,3,22
10399,melisandre, f,melisandre, Let me show you what you have inside you. Come fight death with me.,8,3,14
10400,melisandre, f,melisandre,  You have to trust me.,8,3,5
10401,melisandre, f,melisandre," Don't fight, don't fight. They won't take much.",8,3,8
10402,melisandre, f,melisandre,  I told you there's power in the blood of kings. And you have so much blood.,8,3,16
10403,melisandre, f,melisandre,  You can blame Ser Davos. He didn't believe in the power of king's blood. He wanted a demonstration.,8,3,18
10404,melisandre, f,melisandre, I take no credit. I have faith and my faith has been rewarded.,10,3,13
10405,melisandre, f,melisandre, And our king is still no closer to the Iron Throne. A great gift requires a great sacrifice.,10,3,18
10406,melisandre, f,melisandre, Your mercy saved the boy's life. You feel good about that?,10,3,11
10407,melisandre, f,melisandre, You saved one innocent. How many tens of thousands have you doomed?,10,3,12
10408,melisandre, f,melisandre, Take him away.,10,3,3
10409,melisandre, f,melisandre, My king.,10,3,2
10410,melisandre, f,melisandre," This War of Five Kings means nothing. The true war lies to the north, my king. Death marches on the Wall. Only you can stop him.",10,3,26
10411,melisandre, f,melisandre, He's right. You need him. He has a part to play in the war to come.,10,3,16
10412,melisandre, f,melisandre, I don't know yet. The fires will show me.,3,3,9
10413,melisandre, f,melisandre, I don't know.,3,3,3
10414,melisandre, f,melisandre, I will never abandon you. You are the Son of Fire.  I am sworn to serve you.,3,3,17
10415,melisandre, f,melisandre," When I return, you will understand.",3,3,6
10416,melisandre, f,melisandre, I cannot.,3,3,2
10417,melisandre, f,melisandre, You don't have the strength. It would kill you.,3,3,9
10418,melisandre, f,melisandre," Your fires burn low, my king.",3,3,6
10419,melisandre, f,melisandre, There is another way. A better way.,3,3,7
10420,melisandre, f,melisandre,  Yes.,3,3,1
10421,melisandre, f,melisandre," You are. But there are others with your blood in their veins. You will sit on the Iron Throne, but first there must be sacrifices. The Lord of Light demands it.",3,3,31
10422,melisandre, f,melisandre," How would you punish the infidels, Ser Davos?",1,3,8
10423,melisandre, f,melisandre, I'm not your enemy.,1,3,4
10424,melisandre, f,melisandre," Was it me you fought on Blackwater Bay? Did I set your ships ablaze? I wasn't there when the wildfire killed our men by the thousands. I could have saved those men. You would have taken the city, Stannis would now sit upon his rightful throne, and you would stand beside him. But I wasn't there because you convinced your king to leave me behind. Do you hear them screaming? All those burning men in the water crying for their mothers, for their gods for help? Until the moment the Blackwater swallowed them.",1,3,93
10425,melisandre, f,melisandre," Don't despair, Ser Davos. What I told your son is true.",1,3,11
10426,melisandre, f,melisandre,  Death by fire is the purest death.,1,3,7
10427,melisandre, f,melisandre," You've chosen the darkness, Ser Davos.",1,3,6
10428,melisandre, f,melisandre, I will pray for you.,1,3,5
10429,melisandre, f,melisandre, We come as friends.,6,3,4
10430,melisandre, f,melisandre, Valar morghulis.,6,3,2
10431,melisandre, f,melisandre, (speaks Valyrian) You are Thoros of Myr.,6,3,7
10432,melisandre, f,melisandre, (speaks Valyrian) The High Priest gave you a mission. Turn King Robert away from his idols and towards the Lord of Light. What happened?,6,3,24
10433,melisandre, f,melisandre," (speaks Valyrian) You quit, you mean. The heathen continue to slaughter each other and you continue to get drunk.",6,3,19
10434,melisandre, f,melisandre, How many times has the Lord brought him back?,6,3,9
10435,melisandre, f,melisandre, (speaks Valerian) That's not possible.,6,3,5
10436,melisandre, f,melisandre, (speaks Valerian) You should not have this power.,6,3,8
10437,melisandre, f,melisandre, You've been to the other side.,6,3,6
10438,melisandre, f,melisandre, You have someone He needs.,6,3,5
10439,melisandre, f,melisandre, You are more than they can ever be. They're just foot soldiers in the great war. You will make kings rise and fall.,6,3,23
10440,melisandre, f,melisandre, Wildfire. I should have been here.,7,3,6
10441,melisandre, f,melisandre, Do you miss it?,7,3,4
10442,melisandre, f,melisandre, Your father's house.,7,3,3
10443,melisandre, f,melisandre, Haven't you ever wondered where your strength came from? Your talent for fighting?,7,3,13
10444,melisandre, f,melisandre," Mine was a slave. So was I. Bought and sold, scourged and branded, until the Lord of Light reached down, took me in his hand and raised me up.",7,3,29
10445,melisandre, f,melisandre, Your blood is noble.,7,3,4
10446,melisandre, f,melisandre, There. Your father's house.,7,3,4
10447,melisandre, f,melisandre," The bastard of Robert of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men. Why do you think the gold cloaks wanted you? There is power in a king's blood.",7,3,36
10448,melisandre, f,melisandre," Hear us now. Accept these tokens of our faith, my lord, and lead us from the darkness.",2,4,17
10449,melisandre, f,melisandre," Lord of Light, show us the way...",2,4,7
10450,melisandre, f,melisandre," Lord of Light, protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors.",2,4,14
10451,melisandre, f,melisandre, It's all I knew when I was a child.,2,4,9
10452,melisandre, f,melisandre, Until he found me.,2,4,4
10453,melisandre, f,melisandre, Every mother should fear for her child's soul.,2,4,8
10454,melisandre, f,melisandre," Were you sleeping, Princess?",2,4,4
10455,melisandre, f,melisandre,  Did you watch the ceremony on the beach?,2,4,8
10456,melisandre, f,melisandre, And it frightened you?,2,4,4
10457,melisandre, f,melisandre," They're in a better place now, Princess. The fire cleansed them of the sins of the world.",2,4,17
10458,melisandre, f,melisandre, Women scream when they give birth. Afterward they are filled with joy.,2,4,12
10459,melisandre, f,melisandre," You have so many questions, don't you? So did I when I was a child. I was much like you. Only I wasn't a princess.",2,4,25
10460,melisandre, f,melisandre," No. But I suffered in other ways, sweet girl, believe me. What do you know of the gods?",2,4,18
10461,melisandre, f,melisandre," Lies and fables. Septons speak of seven gods. There are but two... a god of light and love and joy and a god of darkness, evil, and fear. Eternally at war.",2,4,31
10462,melisandre, f,melisandre," There's only one hell, Princess. The one we live in now.",2,4,11
10463,melisandre, f,melisandre," Come in, my queen. Please.",7,4,5
10464,melisandre, f,melisandre, You could never disturb me.,7,4,5
10465,melisandre, f,melisandre, Could you bring me that vial over there? The blue one.,7,4,11
10466,melisandre, f,melisandre," No, no, no. Not that one. You don't even want to touch that one. Next to it. That's the one.",7,4,20
10467,melisandre, f,melisandre," When I looked into the flames this morning, the Lord spoke to me. He said, ""Tonight, you will have your last good bath in a long while. Make it count."" A joke. Not a very good one, I'm afraid.",7,4,39
10468,melisandre, f,melisandre, That's because most jokes are lies and you're devoted to the truth.,7,4,12
10469,melisandre, f,melisandre, Not always.,7,4,2
10470,melisandre, f,melisandre, No. Don't be upset. Men never crave what they already have.,7,4,11
10471,melisandre, f,melisandre, It's only flesh. It needs what it needs.,7,4,8
10472,melisandre, f,melisandre, I understand how you feel.,7,4,5
10473,melisandre, f,melisandre, But that is impossible.,7,4,4
10474,melisandre, f,melisandre," You don't need powders and potions, my queen. You don't need lies. You are strong enough to look into the Lord's light and see his truth for yourself.",7,4,28
10475,melisandre, f,melisandre," However harsh it is. However hard for us to understand. You don't need my help, but I will need yours soon. When we set sail, your daughter must be with us. The Lord needs her.",7,4,35
10476,melisandre, f,melisandre," It will all be over soon, Princess.",9,5,7
10477,melisandre, f,melisandre," The year is now, my Lord. For you we offer up this girl, that you may cleanse her with your fire and that its light may lead our way.",9,5,29
10478,melisandre, f,melisandre," Accept this token of our faith, my lord and lead us from the darkness. Lord of Light show us the way!",9,5,21
10479,melisandre, f,melisandre," Lord of Light protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors!",9,5,14
10480,melisandre, f,melisandre," The Lord of Light has made good on his promise, my king. His fires have melted the snows away. The way ahead is clear.",10,5,24
10481,melisandre, f,melisandre, And you will take it. The Lord has shown me Bolton banners burning. You will receive what is yours by right.,10,5,21
10482,melisandre, f,melisandre, The king wants a word.,1,5,5
10483,melisandre, f,melisandre," Never. The Lord’s fire lives within me, Jon Snow.",1,5,9
10484,melisandre, f,melisandre, Feel.,1,5,1
10485,melisandre, f,melisandre, Are you a virgin?,1,5,4
10486,melisandre, f,melisandre, Good.,1,5,1
10487,melisandre, f,melisandre, Your grace. The bastard of Winterfell.,1,5,6
10488,melisandre, f,melisandre," Man or woman, young or old, lord or peasant, our choices are the same. We choose light, or we choose darkness. We choose good, or we choose evil. We choose the true god or the false.",1,5,36
10489,melisandre, f,melisandre," Free folk, there is only one true king, and his name is Stannis. Here stands the king of lies. Behold the fate of those who choose the darkness.",1,5,28
10490,melisandre, f,melisandre, (Walking towards them). Those scars mean nothing to the Lord of Light.,4,5,12
10491,melisandre, f,melisandre, Her father is the Lord's chosen King. And her father's blood runs through her veins.,4,5,15
10492,melisandre, f,melisandre, You march on Winterfell soon?,4,5,5
10493,melisandre, f,melisandre, Once before you put your faith in Ser Davos and left me behind. I hope you won't make that mistake again.,4,5,21
10494,melisandre, f,melisandre," You only need faith, my King.",4,5,6
10495,melisandre, f,melisandre, To serve my Lord.,4,5,4
10496,melisandre, f,melisandre, Lord Commander.,4,5,2
10497,melisandre, f,melisandre," Come with us when we ride south. (Walks forwards). None of us know the castle as well as you do. Its hidden tunnels, its weaknesses, its people. Winterfell was your home once. Don't you want to chase the rats out of it? (Turns to Jon).",4,5,45
10498,melisandre, f,melisandre, There's only one war. Life against death. Come. Let me show what you're fighting for. (Walks in front of Jon).,4,5,20
10499,melisandre, f,melisandre, No visions. No magic. Just life.,4,5,6
10500,melisandre, f,melisandre," Do you feel my heart beating? This power in you, you resist it, and that's your mistake. Embrace it.",4,5,19
10501,melisandre, f,melisandre," The Lord of Light made us male and female. Two parts of a greater whole. We are joining this power. Power to make life, power to make light, and power to cast shadows.",4,5,33
10502,melisandre, f,melisandre, Then we shouldn't tell him. (Starts unbuttoning Jon’s coat).,4,5,9
10503,melisandre, f,melisandre, Why?,4,5,1
10504,melisandre, f,melisandre, The dead don't need lovers. Only the living.,4,5,8
10505,melisandre, f,melisandre," You know nothing, Jon Snow.",4,5,5
10506,melisandre, f,melisandre," You saw it yourself, my king, when you stared into the flames. A great battle in the snow.",7,5,18
10507,melisandre, f,melisandre, You do know. Trust yourself.,7,5,5
10508,melisandre, f,melisandre, I trust in the Lord.,7,5,5
10509,melisandre, f,melisandre, I have seen myself walk along the battlements of Wintefell. I have seen the flayed men banners lowered to the ground.,7,5,21
10510,melisandre, f,melisandre, But sometimes sacrifices must be made to ensure victory. I have shown you the power of king's blood. The Usurper Robb Stark. The Usurper Joffrey Baratheon.,7,5,26

10718,missandei, f,missandei," White Rat, the Unsullied who… I have heard they found his body in a brothel. I have heard that more than one Unsullied has been known to visit Meereen’s brothels. May I ask you why? Why would an Unsullied go to a brothel?",1,5,43
10719,missandei, f,missandei,  You're still too weak. (He lays back down).,5,5,8
10720,missandei, f,missandei, (Valyrian) Three days.,5,5,3

10723,missandei, f,missandei, Now you have given the Masters what they deserve.,5,5,9
10724,missandei, f,missandei," Your Grace, I think that I am not fit to have an opinion on these matters.",5,5,16
10725,missandei, f,missandei," I can only tell you what I have seen, Your Grace. (Sitting down). I have seen you listen to your counselors. I have seen you lean on their experience when your own was lacking and weigh the choices they put before you. And I have seen you ignore your counselors, because there was a better choice. One that only you could see.",5,5,62
10726,missandei, f,missandei, Glory?,4,5,1
10727,missandei, f,missandei,  Welcome to Dragonstone.  Our queen knows this is a long journey.  She appreciates the effort you have made on her behalf.  If you wouldn't mind handing over your weapons.,3,7,29
10728,missandei, f,missandei,"  Please, this way.",3,7,3
10729,missandei, f,missandei,  I was born on the Island of Naarth.,3,7,8
10730,missandei, f,missandei,"  You stand in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, rightful heir to the Iron Throne, rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, The Unburnt, The Breaker of Chains.",3,7,48
10731,missandei, f,missandei,  They can still do something to you.  It only takes one arrow.,3,7,12
10732,missandei, f,missandei,  And what will they face?,3,7,5
10733,missandei, f,missandei,"  Your Grace, forgive me, but your translation is not quite accurate.  That noun has no gender in High Valyrian, so the proper translation for that prophecy would be the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn.",2,7,39
10734,missandei, f,missandei,  You leave tomorrow.  Were you going to say goodbye?,2,7,9
10735,missandei, f,missandei,  But you don't know when that will be.,2,7,8
10736,missandei, f,missandei,  I wish you good fortune.,2,7,5

10748,missandei, f,missandei,"  Your name is Jon Snow, but your father's name was Ned Stark?",4,7,12
10749,missandei, f,missandei,  We don't have marriage in Naarth so the concept of a bastard doesn't exist.,4,7,14
10750,missandei, f,missandei,  I was stolen away by slavers.,4,7,6
10751,missandei, f,missandei,  She bought me from my master and set me free.,4,7,10
10752,missandei, f,missandei,  I serve my queen because I want to serve my queen.  Because I believe in her.,4,7,16
10753,missandei, f,missandei,  Then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune.,4,7,12
10754,missandei, f,missandei,"  I know it.  All of us who came with her from Essos, we believe in her.  She's not our queen because she's the daughter of some king we never knew.  She's the queen we chose.",4,7,35
10755,missandei, f,missandei, Why did they build it?,7,7,5
10756,missandei, f,missandei, Hello.,2,8,1

10764,missandei, f,missandei, I will be happy when our queen returns.,8,6,8
10765,missandei, f,missandei, I have tried wine before. It made me feel funny.,8,6,10
10766,missandei, f,missandei, I do not know any jokes.,8,6,6
10767,missandei, f,missandei," A joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho. Not a true story, necessarily.",8,6,13
10768,missandei, f,missandei, I do.,8,6,2
10769,missandei, f,missandei, Two translators are on a sinking ship.,8,6,7
10770,missandei, f,missandei," The first says, “Do you know how to swim?” The second says, “No, but I can shout for help in 19 languages.”",8,6,22

10772,missandei, f,missandei, More jokes.,8,6,2
10773,missandei, f,missandei, The Masters have come for their property.,8,6,7
10774,missandei, f,missandei, That changes nothing.,8,6,3
10775,missandei, f,missandei, Who said this?,3,6,3
10776,missandei, f,missandei, My master Kraznys would sometimes make us play games.,3,6,9
10777,missandei, f,missandei, Only the girls.,3,6,3
10778,missandei, f,missandei, We do not drink.,3,6,4
10779,missandei, f,missandei, You found out?,3,6,3
10780,missandei, f,missandei," We cannot. The Masters only speak one language. They spoke it to me for many years. I know it better than my mother tongue. If we want them to hear us, we must speak it back to them. May it be the last thing they ever hear.",3,6,47
10781,missandei, f,missandei, Possibly?,3,6,1
10782,missandei, f,missandei, They are not eating. They haven’t touched any food since Queen Daenerys left.,2,6,13
10783,missandei, f,missandei, How do you know this?,2,6,5
10784,missandei, f,missandei, Many times.,2,6,2
10785,missandei, f,missandei, Never.,2,6,1
10786,missandei, f,missandei, The people know who brought them freedom.,5,6,7
10787,missandei, f,missandei, Our queen tried to make peace with the Masters and they tried to murder her.,4,6,15
10788,missandei, f,missandei, How many days were you a slave?,4,6,7
10789,missandei, f,missandei, Not long enough to understand.,4,6,5
10790,missandei, f,missandei," She refused them because hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children still lived in chains.",4,6,16
10791,missandei, f,missandei, Perhaps I should translate for you.,4,6,6
10792,missandei, f,missandei, I do not trust them. I will never trust them.,4,6,10
10793,missandei, f,missandei," But as a wise man once said, “We make peace with our enemies, not our friends.”",4,6,16
10794,missandei, f,missandei, You promised the slavers they could keep slavery.,4,6,8

10804,davos, m,davos," Forgive me, Your Grace, I'm not a learned man, but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice?  The boy is your nephew.",8,3,23
10805,davos, m,davos,  Because he has your blood in his veins.,8,3,8
10806,davos, m,davos," Renly wronged you. Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you. He raised an army, stole your bannermen. This boy has done you no harm. He's an innocent.",8,3,30
10807,davos, m,davos,"  Your Grace, why did you come to see me today?",8,3,10
10808,davos, m,davos, I swear it. I can't swear never to speak against her.,8,3,11
10809,davos, m,davos," Quite little, Your Grace. Verging on none. You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow, but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife because you knew I'd counsel restraint. You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself. You're not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory. When my son was five he said to me, 'I don't ever want to die. ' I wanted to say to him, 'You won't, child. You won't ever.' I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid. I think mothers and fathers made up the gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night.",8,3,117
10810,davos, m,davos, How are you keeping?,10,3,4
10811,davos, m,davos, It was just a bit of blood.,10,3,7
10812,davos, m,davos, I'm not a highborn.,10,3,4
10813,davos, m,davos, A recent state of affairs. I was born in Flea Bottom just like you.,10,3,14
10814,davos, m,davos, I lived below the Street of Flour.,10,3,7
10815,davos, m,davos, The shit that poured from their privy pipes flowed down the side of Aegon's Hill along Tanner's Row and right in front of my front door on Gin Alley.,10,3,29
10816,davos, m,davos," The Street of Steel, with your armor and your knights? Pfft. You lived in the fancy part of town. And here we are now. Two boys from Flea Bottom in the castle of a king.",10,3,35
10817,davos, m,davos," If you mistrust fancy people so much, why were you in such a hurry to trust her?",10,3,17
10818,davos, m,davos," She does know her way around a man's head, I'll give her that.",10,3,13
10819,davos, m,davos," Oh, that's a long story.",10,3,5
10820,davos, m,davos, Many years ago I helped King Stannis out of a difficult situation. He rewarded me with a lordship. And this.,10,3,20
10821,davos, m,davos, I didn't want to be a lord. I nearly didn't accept.,10,3,11
10822,davos, m,davos, I did it for my son. I didn't want him to step over a river of shit every time he stepped through his front door. I wanted him to have a better life.,10,3,33
10823,davos, m,davos, He's dead.,10,3,2

10827,davos, m,davos, I've been trying to stay out of those dungeons my whole life.,10,3,12
10828,davos, m,davos," Aye, old Balerion's definitely better than anything your cousin Rylene's got on offer. But now that I'm your father's Hand again, I have to keep him informed. The king does not have time for this drudgery. 'To all the lords and knobble men of Westeros.'",10,3,45
10829,davos, m,davos, Stay here. Bar the door.,10,3,5
10830,davos, m,davos, And you take credit because you dropped a leech into the fire?,10,3,12
10831,davos, m,davos," Your Grace, the world has got so far bent. I've seen things crawl out of nightmares, but my eyes were open. I don't know if Robb Stark died because of the Red Woman's sorcery or because at war men die all the time, but I do know that uniting the Seven Kingdoms with blood magic is wrong. It is evil. And you are not an evil man.",10,3,67

10839,davos, m,davos," Aim for that star. Don't stop. There's bread and water. Go slow with it. If you finish it off, no matter how thirsty you get, don't drink seawater.",10,3,28
10840,davos, m,davos, Row for a full day and night and you'll reach Rook's Rest. You'll want to stop there. Don't. She'll find you.,10,3,21
10841,davos, m,davos, You must keep the coast on your left side until you reach King's Landing.,10,3,14
10842,davos, m,davos, They were looking for me for 20 years. Do they know your face?,10,3,13
10843,davos, m,davos, I'd worry more about the Red Woman.,10,3,7
10844,davos, m,davos, The other way.,10,3,3

10854,davos, m,davos, Matthos taught me before he died so I could be of better service to you.,10,3,15
10855,davos, m,davos," You can't stop him alone. You need someone to rebuild your army for you, someone to convince this lord and that lord to fight for you, to bring sellswords and pirates to your side.",10,3,34

10923,davos, m,davos," Your Grace, if you'd like to sit, I'm sure that--",6,4,10
10924,davos, m,davos," Easterners have a difference sense of time, I've often found. Once I was waiting for Salladhor Saan here in Braavos. Together, we were going to run three shiploads of the finest--",6,4,31
10925,davos, m,davos," This is Stannis of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.",6,4,25
10926,davos, m,davos, 32.,6,4,1
10927,davos, m,davos, My lord.,6,4,2
10928,davos, m,davos," Well, strictly speaking, I didn't do the thieving. That would be the pirates. I just moved what they stole from one place to another.  {DAVOS removes his right glove to show the stubs of his fingers.",6,4,36
10929,davos, m,davos," This is the payment that was demanded by King Stannis for my crimes. I consider it an honest accounting. He's an honest man and he's your best chance to get back the money you've sunk into Westeros. Which is a lot, I imagine. Wars are expensive.",6,4,46
10930,davos, m,davos," As long as Stannis lives, the war is not over. Who's the real power in King's Landing?",6,4,17
10931,davos, m,davos, Humor me.,6,4,2
10932,davos, m,davos," Begging your pardon, I think it's a problem for now. There's only one reliable leader left in Westeros. Stannis. He's got the birthright. He's in his prime. He's a tried and tested battle commander. And he doesn't just talk about paying people back, he does it.",6,4,46
10933,davos, m,davos, You think they ever met a pirate who didn't tell them that joke?,6,4,13
10934,davos, m,davos, Only half rotted.,6,4,3
10935,davos, m,davos," No time, I'm afraid. We sail at sunrise.",6,4,8
10936,davos, m,davos, You won't be alone. And you won't be poor.,6,4,9
10937,davos, m,davos, There's a chest of the good stuff left back at your house. I gave it to your wife.,6,4,18
10938,davos, m,davos, (laughs) I'll see you at sunrise.,6,4,6
10939,davos, m,davos," A band of 20 men, maybe less. They were in and out before anyone spotted them, burnt our food stores to the ground, all our siege weapons were destroyed, dozens of tents were--",9,5,33
10940,davos, m,davos," We’re still getting a count, but hundreds are dead.",9,5,9
10941,davos, m,davos, The northerners know more about their land than we ever will.,9,5,11
10942,davos, m,davos," Unless there’s a thaw, we can’t press forward to Winterfell, and we don’t have enough food to get us back to Castle Black.",9,5,23
10943,davos, m,davos," Forgive me, Your Grace, I never claimed to be an expert in military matters. But if we can’t march forward, and we won’t march back…",9,5,25
10944,davos, m,davos," You sent for me, Your Grace.",9,5,6
10945,davos, m,davos," Your Grace, you’ve named me your Hand.",9,5,7
10946,davos, m,davos," The King’s Hand should never abandon the King, especially in a time of war.",9,5,14
10947,davos, m,davos, A boy with a scroll could deliver this message.,9,5,9
10948,davos, m,davos," Your Grace, perhaps Queen and Princess Shireen could accompany me.",9,5,10
10949,davos, m,davos, At least let me take Shireen. A siege is no place for a little girl.,9,5,15
10950,davos, m,davos, What’s this one now?,9,5,4
10951,davos, m,davos, Well that sounds like a proper story.,9,5,7
10952,davos, m,davos," But the dragon only saw a dumb man, holding a mirrored shield.",9,5,12
10953,davos, m,davos," Thus ending the dragonslaying career of Ser Byron Swann. I made you something, Princess.",9,5,14
10954,davos, m,davos, Do you like it?,9,5,4
10955,davos, m,davos, You’re very welcome.,9,5,3
10956,davos, m,davos, Of course I will.,9,5,4
10957,davos, m,davos," Because you deserve it. My son was always on me trying to teach me to read. Gods, I was stubborn about it. Made it this far without reading, seemed to me I could make it to the grave. I wish I had listened to them. This is my own poor way of saying thank you for teaching me to be a grown up. (beat) I’ll be gone for a few days, Princess. I’ll want to hear all about the dance of dragons when I’m back.",9,5,85
10958,davos, m,davos, He came to your aid. Stannis. Now he needs you!,10,5,10
10959,davos, m,davos, The wildlings will make a difference!,10,5,6
10960,davos, m,davos," You saved their bloody lives. If they’re going to live in the Seven Kingdoms, safe behind our wall, they ought to fight for the damn place.",10,5,26
10961,davos, m,davos, Shireen? The princess?,10,5,3
10962,davos, m,davos," He sees something in you. (Jon looks up). Might not be apparent from his tone, but it's the truth. He believes in you.",3,5,23
10963,davos, m,davos, The king is a complicated man. But he wants what's right for the Seven Kingdoms.,3,5,15
10964,davos, m,davos, He's the one true king. He has the blood right to that throne.,3,5,13
10965,davos, m,davos, Have you now? (Turning to Olly). How does the Night's Watch vow go again? I bet you've got it memorized since you got here.,3,5,24
10966,davos, m,davos," Not that bit, the bit at the end.",3,5,8
10967,davos, m,davos," Wait, that's enough. “The shield that guards the realm of men.” That's what you swore to be. Now I'm not a learned man, but the best way of helping the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world. It just might mean wading in the muck, getting your boots dirty, and doing what needs to be doing.",3,5,65
10968,davos, m,davos," As long as the Boltons rule the North, (Stands up), the North will suffer. Just one man's opinion.",3,5,18
10969,davos, m,davos," Tonight, the Night's Watch elect a new Lord Commander. Ser Alliser Thorne is going to win.",2,5,16
10970,davos, m,davos, Unpleasant man. He thinks you're a traitor. What's your life going to be like on the Wall with Thorne in command?,2,5,21
10971,davos, m,davos, I’ve been talking to your sworn brothers. Many of them love you.,1,5,12
10972,davos, m,davos, Many don’t. You were seen taking the body of a wildling girl north of the Wall. Why?,1,5,17
10973,davos, m,davos, Some of the Night’s Watch feel you have too much affection for the wildlings.,1,5,14
10974,davos, m,davos, It’s a fair offer. More than fair.,1,5,7
10975,davos, m,davos, What?,5,5,1
10976,davos, m,davos," Uh, Your Grace. Wouldn't it be better to wait? When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings, we could have thousands more men.",5,5,22
10977,davos, m,davos, I'll choose a dozen men to stay and guard the queen and the princess.,5,5,14
10978,davos, m,davos," It's a tough road ahead, Your Grace. Won't they be safer -",5,5,12
10979,davos, m,davos," As you wish, Your Grace.",5,5,5
10980,davos, m,davos, Beg your pardon?,5,5,3
10981,davos, m,davos, First things first. It's a long march ahead. And then we have to take the castle.,5,5,16
10982,davos, m,davos," Aye, princess, but you won't be anywhere near -",5,5,9
10983,davos, m,davos," Yes, my queen.",5,5,3
10984,davos, m,davos," Well, I am. When the battle comes, promise you'll protect me.",5,5,11
10985,davos, m,davos, 40 horses died in the night. We’ll lose more come sunset. We’re running out of food. We can’t open the supply line until the snow clears.,7,5,26
10986,davos, m,davos, The Stormcrows rode off last night.,7,5,6
10987,davos, m,davos, We still have a hard march to Wintefell and we won’t be marching anywhere in this weather.,7,5,17
10988,davos, m,davos," This isn’t our time, we should head back to Castle Black when the snow clears.",7,5,15
10989,davos, m,davos, Your Grace..,7,5,2
10990,davos, m,davos, It’s better to wait for the right time than to risk everything.,7,5,12
10991,davos, m,davos, Your Grace. (leaves),7,5,3
10992,davos, m,davos," Aye, but we have the wind. She'll blow us straight to the gates.",9,2,13
10993,davos, m,davos, King's Landing hasn't been home for 20 years. I spent most of my life dodging the royal fleet. And now I'm sailing right at them.,9,2,25
10994,davos, m,davos," Of course, there are several royal fleets at the moment.",9,2,10
10995,davos, m,davos, Gods be good.,9,2,3
10996,davos, m,davos, But not over them?,9,2,4
10997,davos, m,davos," Well, first, we have to put it there.",9,2,8
10998,davos, m,davos," Our army outnumber theirs 5-to-1. Those walls have never been breached, and the men guarding the walls, when they see you, they don't see a liberator, they see a stranger come to set their city on fire.",9,2,37
10999,davos, m,davos, I've never known bells to mean surrender. They want to play music with us? Let's play. Drums.,9,2,17
11000,davos, m,davos, Where are their ships?,9,2,4
11001,davos, m,davos, Lord Varys knows what you had for breakfast three days ago. There are no surprises here.,9,2,16
11002,davos, m,davos, Maybe.,9,2,1
11003,davos, m,davos, Draw! Hold.,9,2,2
11004,davos, m,davos, (confused) There's no one on board.,9,2,6
11005,davos, m,davos, Wildfire. Steer clear! Steer clear!,9,2,5
11006,davos, m,davos, Matthos! Get down!,9,2,3
11007,davos, m,davos," If the wind holds, we'll reach King's Landing in a day.",8,2,11
11008,davos, m,davos," Can't make promises for the wind, Your Grace.",8,2,8
11009,davos, m,davos," I thank you, Your Grace.",8,2,5
11010,davos, m,davos," My son wishes me to change it. Three mermen with tridents, something like that. I understand why the older families look down at me.",8,2,24
11011,davos, m,davos, My father was a crabber.,8,2,5
11012,davos, m,davos,"  Well, sons of lords don't like to break bread with sons of crabbers. Our hands stink.",8,2,16
11013,davos, m,davos, Many fought bravely for your brother. Many fought for the Mad King.,8,2,12
11014,davos, m,davos, Some are happy to do it to my face.,8,2,9
11015,davos, m,davos," No one has forgotten, Your Grace.",8,2,6
11016,davos, m,davos, He was only a boy.,8,2,5
11017,davos, m,davos, (exhales),8,2,1
11018,davos, m,davos," And potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe.",8,2,7
11019,davos, m,davos, I was relieved they did not.,8,2,6
11020,davos, m,davos," Your Grace, I pray I serve you well.",8,2,8
11021,davos, m,davos, You'll have your gold when we take the treasury at King's Landing.,2,2,12
11022,davos, m,davos," Because you're a smart gambler. Stannis has proved himself in war. Twice. His baby brother has never set foot on a battlefield. Neither has the false king, Joffrey.",2,2,28
11023,davos, m,davos, Stannis has just begun the fight. His bannermen will rally to his cause. There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms more honorable than Stannis Baratheon. Or more worthy of loyalty.,2,2,30
11024,davos, m,davos, Matthos.,2,2,1
11025,davos, m,davos," Of course you do. Every time you leave harbor, you're leaving on a promise. A promise that somewhere on the seas, somebody's got some gold and you can take it from them.",2,2,32
11026,davos, m,davos," You want to spend your last few years on the sea, stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers and Midanese silk merchants, then go. They're out there waiting for you. That's easy. What I'm offering you is hard. Come with me and plunder the greatest city in Westeros. You'll be the richest man in Lysene. And the most famous. They'll be singing songs about you as long as men have voices to sing.",2,2,70
11027,davos, m,davos, It is. (Matthos rolls his eyes).,2,2,6
11028,davos, m,davos, The queen?,2,2,2
11029,davos, m,davos, He's young yet. I promise you the gold. I promise you the glory. I cannot promise you the queen.,2,2,19
11030,davos, m,davos, He is the one true king.,2,2,6
11031,davos, m,davos, Get me to the gates of King's Landing and I will.,2,2,11
11032,davos, m,davos, As soon as his God wills it.,2,2,7
11033,davos, m,davos, Oh you and your mother.,2,2,5
11034,davos, m,davos," I wish I had a God, truly! I'm not mocking you, but I've seen men pray to every God there is. Pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home. None of it works!",2,2,34
11035,davos, m,davos, I wasn't praying.,2,2,3
11036,davos, m,davos," You want me to have a god, fine. King Stannis is my god. He raised me up and blessed me with his trust. He gave you a future I could never have imagined. You know how to read, you'll be a knight someday. You think your fire god commanded all that? It was Stannis. Only Stannis.",2,2,56
11037,davos, m,davos, Don't tell him that.,2,2,4
11038,davos, m,davos, Your Grace.,2,2,2
11039,davos, m,davos, Salladhor Saan will join our fleet. 30 ships. His men know how to fight.,2,2,14
11040,davos, m,davos, Does seem the wiser choice.,2,2,5
11041,davos, m,davos," Salladhor Saan is an old friend, I've known him 30 years. I've never trusted him.",2,2,15
11042,davos, m,davos," At once, Your Grace.",2,2,4
11043,davos, m,davos, Come.,2,2,1
11044,davos, m,davos, (Looks to Stannis) Not now.,1,2,5
11045,davos, m,davos," Stannis is our king. We follow where he leads, even if we don't like the path.",1,2,16
11046,davos, m,davos, I don't serve the others. I serve Stannis.,1,2,8
11047,davos, m,davos, What's the truth?,1,2,3
11048,davos, m,davos," A harmless courtesy, Your Grace.",1,2,5
11049,davos, m,davos," Your Grace, the Lannisters are the true enemy. If, for the time being, you could make peace with your brother -",1,2,21
11050,davos, m,davos," Well, many have already declared for him; Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly.",1,2,11
11051,davos, m,davos, And how many ships has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?,1,2,13
11052,davos, m,davos," I'm sure he doesn't, but we do if we're going to war. If not Renly, Your Grace, join forces with Robb Stark.",1,2,22
11053,davos, m,davos, (Whispers to Cressen) Don't.,1,2,4
11054,davos, m,davos, Your Grace.,5,2,2
11055,davos, m,davos," I'm sorry about your brother, Your Grace, I wanted to let you know that people grieve for him.",5,2,18
11056,davos, m,davos," Your Grace, I --",5,2,4
11057,davos, m,davos, And I've never known you to hide from the truth.,5,2,10
11058,davos, m,davos, I've come to tell you that what I saw.,5,2,9
11059,davos, m,davos," Nothing is worth what this will cost you, not even the Iron",5,2,12
11060,davos, m,davos, When do we sail for King's Landing?,5,2,7
11061,davos, m,davos, And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?,5,2,8
11062,davos, m,davos," If you take King's Landing with her by your side, the victory will be hers.",5,2,15
11063,davos, m,davos, Loyal service means telling hard truths.,5,2,6
11064,davos, m,davos, She's a foreigner preaching her foreign religion. Some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey.,5,2,18
11065,davos, m,davos, You won those bannermen from Renly. Don't lose them to her.,5,2,11
11066,davos, m,davos," Your Grace, I'm honored, but my time on the sea was spent evading ships, not attacking them. The other lords won't be happy.",5,2,23
11067,davos, m,davos, Your Grace.,4,2,2
11068,davos, m,davos," Well, life's been good since you hacked them off, Your Grace. And it's four less fingernails to clean.",4,2,18
11069,davos, m,davos, Pardon?,4,2,1
11070,davos, m,davos, It reminds me of where I come from and where I am now. It reminds me of your justice. It was an honest punishment and you were good with the cleaver.,4,2,31
11071,davos, m,davos, A lesson I've tried to teach my son.,4,2,8
11072,davos, m,davos," To me? Gods, no. But if your red woman told him to leap from the crow's nest",4,2,17
11073,davos, m,davos, I've lived within the law for 17,4,2,7
11074,davos, m,davos," Any shore, any night. What am I bringing ashore?",4,2,9
11075,davos, m,davos," I am true to Your Grace and always will be, but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways.",4,2,18
11076,davos, m,davos, Someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors.,4,2,12
11077,davos, m,davos," I'd say my parts are mixed, my lady, good and bad.",4,2,11
11078,davos, m,davos, And which are you?,4,2,4
11079,davos, m,davos," Well, that must be very nice for you.",4,2,8
11080,davos, m,davos, I do.,4,2,2
11081,davos, m,davos, Don't talk about my wife.,4,2,5
11082,davos, m,davos, Strange that this Lord of Light asks you to work in the shadows.,4,2,13
11083,davos, m,davos, These weren't here before. They've barred the passage.,4,2,8
11084,davos, m,davos, Gods protect us.,4,2,3
11085,davos, m,davos,  Davos Seaworth.,3,7,2
11086,davos, m,davos,  Unluckily for me.,3,7,3
11087,davos, m,davos,  Where are you from?  I can't place the accent.,3,7,9
11088,davos, m,davos,  Ah.  I hear it's beautiful down there.  Palm trees and butterflies.  I haven't been myself.,3,7,15
11089,davos, m,davos,  This place has changed.,3,7,4
11090,davos, m,davos,  This is Jon Snow.,3,7,4
11091,davos, m,davos,  He's King in the North.,3,7,5
11092,davos, m,davos,"  Apologies.  I have a Flea Bottom accent, I know.  But Jon Snow is King in the North, Your Grace.  He's not a lord.",3,7,23
11093,davos, m,davos,"  I wasn't there, Your Grace.",3,7,5
11094,davos, m,davos,"  Not to defeat Cersei.  You could storm King's Landing tomorrow and the city would fall.  Hell, we almost took it and we didn't even have dragons.",3,7,26
11095,davos, m,davos,  You don't believe him.  I understand that.  It sounds like nonsense.,3,7,11
11096,davos, m,davos,"  But if destiny has brough Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores, it has also made Jon Snow King in the North.  You were the first to bring Dothraki to Westeros.  He was the first to make allies with Wildlings and northmen.  He was named Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.  He was named King in the North.  Not because of his birthright.  He has no birthright.  He's a damn bastard.  All those hard son's of bitches chose him as their leader because they believe in him.",3,7,86
11097,davos, m,davos,"  All those things you don't believe in, he faced those things.  He fought those things for the good of his people.  He risked his life for his people.  He took a knife in the heart for his people.  He gave his own --",3,7,43
11098,davos, m,davos,  If we don't put asside our enmities and band together we will die.  And then it doesn't matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.,3,7,25
11099,davos, m,davos,"  Sounds like a charmer.  Of course, the casual mention of a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied and three dragons, a bit less charming.",2,7,24
11100,davos, m,davos,"  Fire kills Whites, you told me.  What breathes fire?",2,7,9
11101,davos, m,davos,"  No, too dangerous.",2,7,3
11102,davos, m,davos,"  But if the Army of the Dead makes it passed the Wall, do we have enough men to fight them?",2,7,20
11103,davos, m,davos,  Is that possible?,5,7,3
11104,davos, m,davos,"  I can smuggle you in, but if the Goldcloaks were to recognize you, I'm warning you, I'm not a fighter.",5,7,20
11105,davos, m,davos,  They won't follow Ser Jorah.,5,7,5
11106,davos, m,davos,  You can't lead a raid beyond the wall.  You're not in the Night's Watch anymore.  You're King in the North.,5,7,20
11107,davos, m,davos,  Last time I was here you killed my son with wildfire.,5,7,11
11108,davos, m,davos,  There's a path to the left that hugs the cliff.  The guards hardly ever patrol it.  Too many steps.,5,7,19
11109,davos, m,davos,  I've got my own business in Flea Bottom.,5,7,8
11110,davos, m,davos,  Then we're fucked.  Best hurry.,5,7,5
11111,davos, m,davos,  I wasn't sure I'd find you.,5,7,6
11112,davos, m,davos,  I thought you might still be rowing.,5,7,7
11113,davos, m,davos,"  I looked in shops, taverns, brothels.  I should have known to come straight to the Street of Steel.",5,7,18
11114,davos, m,davos,  I haven't been here in years.  Why should they recognize me?  Sometimes I hardly do.  Nothing fucks you harder than time.,5,7,21
11115,davos, m,davos,  Anybody give you any trouble?,5,7,5
11116,davos, m,davos,  Don't be so sure.  Safety is never a permanent state of affairs.  Bad things are coming.,5,7,16
11117,davos, m,davos,  I think you need to understand --,5,7,7
11118,davos, m,davos,  You should know what you're heading into.,5,7,7
11119,davos, m,davos,  You might want to bring one of those swords.,5,7,9
11120,davos, m,davos,  Keep your father's name to yourself.  The situation is complicated enough already.,5,7,12
11121,davos, m,davos,"  I told you, Clovis, if we don't get out of here soon someone is going to --",5,7,17
11122,davos, m,davos,"  No weapons, friends.  I promise.  What can I do for you?",5,7,11
11123,davos, m,davos,  It is.,5,7,2
11124,davos, m,davos,  Still five gold dragons?,5,7,4
11125,davos, m,davos,  15?,5,7,1
11126,davos, m,davos,  I can't say it was a pleasure doing business with you.,5,7,11
11127,davos, m,davos,  Not more gold.,5,7,3
11128,davos, m,davos,  Come and have a look.,5,7,5
11129,davos, m,davos,  Fermented crab.,5,7,2
11130,davos, m,davos,"  Fermented crab.  One bucket of this triples the brothel's earnings for the week.  A man thinks he's done, he's ready to go back to his loving family, but before he gets his britches up his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth.  Five minutes later, he's back in the race.  Here, have a taste.",5,7,60
11131,davos, m,davos,  I'd hurry to your favorite establishment or you'll put a whole in that chainmail.,5,7,14
11132,davos, m,davos,  I really wouldn't try anymore until you see how the first bite hits you.,5,7,14
11133,davos, m,davos,  Perhaps there's some arrangement?,5,7,4
11134,davos, m,davos,  This is Gendry.,5,7,3
11135,davos, m,davos,  We're leaving today.  The king's got a lot on his mind.,5,7,11
11136,davos, m,davos,  He doesn't need to be thinking about harboring the bastard of a dead king.,5,7,14
11137,davos, m,davos,"  You're just Clovis, a smith who's come to pay his respects before he heads off to work at the Winterfell forges.",5,7,21
11138,davos, m,davos,"  Begging your pardon, Your Grace.",5,7,5
11139,davos, m,davos,  Yet again.,5,7,2
11140,davos, m,davos,  He was meant to keep that to himself.,5,7,8
11141,davos, m,davos,  Don't be a fool.  You're not a soldier.,5,7,8
11142,davos, m,davos,  He can handle himself.,5,7,4
11143,davos, m,davos,"  As my father used to say, it's better to be a coward for a minute than dead for the rest of your life.",5,7,23
11144,davos, m,davos,  Yeah.  Nobody mind me.  All I've ever done is live to a ripe old age.,5,7,15
11145,davos, m,davos,  I've been failing at that job of late.,5,7,8
11146,davos, m,davos,  I'll be staying behind.  I'm a liability out there as you well know.,5,7,13
11147,davos, m,davos,  Our reasons aren't your reasons.,5,7,5
11148,davos, m,davos,  You'll want to discuss this amongst yourselves.  Perhaps --,4,7,9
11149,davos, m,davos,  What do you think of her?,4,7,6
11150,davos, m,davos,  I believe you know of whom I speak.,4,7,8
11151,davos, m,davos,  A good heart?  I've noticed you starring at that good heart.,4,7,11
11152,davos, m,davos,  Fewer.,4,7,1
11153,davos, m,davos,"  Speaking of good hearts, Missandei of Naarth.",4,7,7
11154,davos, m,davos,"  King Snow, isn't it?  No?  That doesn't sound right.  King Jon?",4,7,11
11155,davos, m,davos,  Is the custom different in Naarth?,4,7,6
11156,davos, m,davos,  The sounds liberating.,4,7,3
11157,davos, m,davos,"  If I may, how did a slave girl come to advise Daenerys Targaryen?",4,7,13
11158,davos, m,davos,"  That was good of her.  Of course you're serving her now, aren't you?",4,7,13
11159,davos, m,davos,  You'll forgive me if I switch sides.,4,7,7
11160,davos, m,davos,  We heard your uncle attacked your fleet.  We thought you were dead.,4,7,12
11161,davos, m,davos,  Your sister?,4,7,2
11162,davos, m,davos, Maybe it still is.,7,7,4
11163,davos, m,davos, I wish you hadn't done that.,7,7,6
11164,davos, m,davos, Any ideas as to how we might change that state of affairs?,7,7,12
11165,davos, m,davos," You are now. Look, I made it through most of my years without ever getting near a fight, but then I survived the Battle of the Bastards. Right outside these walls. If I can live through that, you can live through this. They'll outfit you with weapons at the forge. Right that way.",2,8,53
11166,davos, m,davos, Which way do you want to go?,2,8,7
11167,davos, m,davos, I'm sure a lot of people would.,2,8,7
11168,davos, m,davos, We'll hold off the rest of them for as long as we can.,2,8,13
11169,davos, m,davos, The dragons should give us an edge in the field.,2,8,10
11170,davos, m,davos," Well, what do we have here?",2,8,6
11171,davos, m,davos," No, not for me, thanks. Came here for this.",2,8,9
11172,davos, m,davos, I figured I could wait to die freezing my balls off out there or wait to die nice and warm in here.,2,8,22
11173,davos, m,davos, Maybe I will have that drink.,2,8,6
11174,davos, m,davos, All without a shred of combat ability.,2,8,7
11175,davos, m,davos, We're out of wine.,2,8,4
11176,davos, m,davos, You'll pray for a quick death.,2,8,6
11177,davos, m,davos, Can't argue with that.,1,8,4
11178,davos, m,davos," Not so long ago, the Starks and the Karstarks were slaughtering each other on the battlefield. Jon Snow brought peace to the houses.",1,8,23
11179,davos, m,davos," Her gratitude is lovely, but that's not my point. The Northmen are loyal to Jon Snow, not to her. They don't know her. The Free Folk don't know her. I've been up here a while, and I'm telling you, they're stubborn as goats. You want their loyalty, you have to earn it.",1,8,52
11180,davos, m,davos," A proposal is what I'm proposing. On the off chance that we survive the Night King, what if the Seven Kingdoms, for once in their whole shit history, were ruled by a just woman and an honorable man?",1,8,38
11181,davos, m,davos, To Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End.,4,8,7
11182,davos, m,davos," The last time I saw her, I told her I'd kill her if I ever saw her again.",4,8,18
11183,davos, m,davos,  I did. I do.,4,8,4
11184,davos, m,davos," Never got the chance. She did it to herself. Or her god did it to her. Lord of Light. We play his game for him, we fight his war and win, and then he fucks off. No signs, no blessings. Who knows what he wants?",4,8,45
11185,davos, m,davos, And what if I'm not trying to be happy?,4,8,9
11186,davos, m,davos,  Thank you. I feel much better.,4,8,6
11187,davos, m,davos,  We all did.,4,8,3
11188,davos, m,davos,"  That's right, you did.",4,8,4
11189,davos, m,davos, How much more defeated do you want them to be? They're on their knees.,6,8,14
11190,davos, m,davos," Look around you, friend. We won.",6,8,6
11191,davos, m,davos," Easy, men. Easy! Easy.",6,8,4
11192,davos, m,davos, Jon. We should speak with the queen.,6,8,7
11193,davos, m,davos," Friends, please. We've been cutting each other's throats long enough. Torgo Nudho. Am I saying that properly?",6,8,17
11194,davos, m,davos," If it weren't for you and your men, we would've lost the war with the dead. This country owes you a debt it can never repay, but let us try. There is land in the Reach. Good land. The people that used to live there are gone. Make it your own. Start your own house with the Unsullied as your bannermen. We've had enough war. Thousands of you, thousands of them. You know how it ends. We need to find a better way.",6,8,83
11195,davos, m,davos,"  Who, then?",6,8,2
11196,davos, m,davos," I'm not sure I get a vote, but aye.",6,8,9
11197,davos, m,davos, Your Grace.,6,8,2
11198,davos, m,davos,  Long may he reign.,6,8,4
11199,davos, m,davos, We have. These projects will begin as soon as the Master of Coin and Lord of Lofty Titles provides funding.,6,8,20
11200,davos, m,davos," ""Any more.""",6,8,2
11201,davos, m,davos," That’s not his way. He knows the North is watching. If the other houses sense weakness on his part, they’ll stop fearing him. He can’t have that. Fear is his power.",9,6,31
11202,davos, m,davos," It’s crucial that we let them charge at us. They’ve got the numbers, we need the patience. If we let him buckle our center, he’ll pursue. Then we’ll have him surrounded on three sides.",9,6,34
11203,davos, m,davos, We should all get some sleep.,9,6,6
11204,davos, m,davos, You think there’s hope?,9,6,4
11205,davos, m,davos, It wasn’t the Boltons defeated Stannis. It was Stannis himself. I loved the man. He lifted me up and made me something. But he had demons in his skull whispering foul things.,9,6,32
11206,davos, m,davos, What?,9,6,1
11207,davos, m,davos," No, it’s a manner of speaking. Not actual demons.",9,6,9
11208,davos, m,davos," Maybe that was our mistake, believing in kings.",9,6,8
11209,davos, m,davos," No, he’s not.",9,6,3
11210,davos, m,davos," No, thanks. It does sound delicious, but I better keep a clear head. I can never sleep the night before a battle.",9,6,22
11211,davos, m,davos, I walk. Think and walk. Think and walk until I’m far enough away from camp that no one can hear me shitting my guts out.,9,6,25
11212,davos, m,davos, Prepare to charge! Prepare to charge!,9,6,6
11213,davos, m,davos, Go! Go! Follow your commander!,9,6,5
11214,davos, m,davos, We’ll just kill our own men. Stand down.,9,6,8
11215,davos, m,davos, We may as well be taking shits back here.,9,6,9
11216,davos, m,davos, Follow!,9,6,1
11217,davos, m,davos," With me, lads! Break their line!",9,6,6
11218,davos, m,davos, Tell him. Tell him who it belonged to.,10,6,8
11219,davos, m,davos, Tell him what you did to her. Tell him!,10,6,9
11220,davos, m,davos, Why?,10,6,1
11221,davos, m,davos, You burned a little girl alive!,10,6,6
11222,davos, m,davos," If he commands you to burn children, your Lord is evil!",10,6,11
11223,davos, m,davos, I loved that girl like she was my own. She was good. She was kind. And you killed her!,10,6,19
11224,davos, m,davos," The only way for what? They all died anyway! You told everyone Stannis was the one. You had him believing it, all of them fooled. And you lied.",10,6,28
11225,davos, m,davos," Aye, you were wrong. How many died because you were wrong?",10,6,11
11226,davos, m,davos, I ask your leave to execute this woman for murder. She admits to the crime.,10,6,15
11227,davos, m,davos," If you ever come back this way, I will execute you myself.",10,6,12
11228,davos, m,davos," Easy, easy. Easy.",3,6,3
11229,davos, m,davos, What do you remember?,3,6,4
11230,davos, m,davos, The lady brought you back.,3,6,5
11231,davos, m,davos, Could you give us a moment?,3,6,6
11232,davos, m,davos," You were dead. And now you’re not. That’s completely fucking mad, seems to me. I can only imagine how it seems to you.",3,6,23
11233,davos, m,davos, I don’t know. Maybe we’ll never know. What does it matter? You go on. You fight for as long as you can. You clean up as much of the shit as you can.,3,6,33
11234,davos, m,davos, Good. Now go fail again.,3,6,5
11235,davos, m,davos, I’ve never been much of a fighter.,2,6,7
11236,davos, m,davos, Apologies for what you’re about to see.,2,6,7
11237,davos, m,davos," I'm sorry, my lady. I didn’t mean to interrupt.",2,6,9
11238,davos, m,davos, I assume you know why I’m here.,2,6,7
11239,davos, m,davos, It’s about the Lord Commander.,2,6,5
11240,davos, m,davos, Does he have to be?,2,6,5
11241,davos, m,davos, Do you know of any magic...that could help him? Bring him back?,2,6,12
11242,davos, m,davos, Can it be done?,2,6,4
11243,davos, m,davos, How?,2,6,1
11244,davos, m,davos, Have you seen it done?,2,6,5
11245,davos, m,davos, But it was. It could be now.,2,6,7
11246,davos, m,davos, Not for you? I saw you drink poison that should’ve killed you. I saw you give birth to a demon made of shadows.,2,6,23
11247,davos, m,davos," Fuck him, then. Fuck all of them. I’m not a devout man, obviously. Seven Gods, drowned gods, tree gods, it's all the same.",2,6,23
11248,davos, m,davos, I’m not asking the Lord of Light for help.I’m asking the woman who showed me that miracles exist.,2,6,18
11249,davos, m,davos, Have you ever tried?,2,6,4
11250,davos, m,davos, Help me get him inside.,1,6,5
11251,davos, m,davos, How many of your brothers do you think you can trust?,1,6,11
11252,davos, m,davos, Does the wolf know you?,1,6,5
11253,davos, m,davos, We need all the help we can get.,1,6,8
11254,davos, m,davos," I can’t speak for the flames, but he’s gone.",1,6,9
11255,davos, m,davos, He’ll have seen we didn’t come. Thorne will have made it official by now. Castle Black is his.,1,6,18
11256,davos, m,davos, We don’t have the numbers.,1,6,5
11257,davos, m,davos," It’s not enough. I didn’t know Lord Commander Snow for long, but I have to believe he wouldn’t have wanted his friends to die for nothing.",1,6,26
11258,davos, m,davos," We need to fight, but we don’t need to die. Not if we have help.",1,6,15
11259,davos, m,davos, You’re not the only ones who owe your lives to Jon Snow.,1,6,12
11260,davos, m,davos," Hear that, lads? Nothing to fear.",1,6,6
11261,davos, m,davos, And some mutton. I’d like some mutton.,1,6,7
11262,davos, m,davos, I’m not much of a hunter. I’ll need some food if I’m gonna make it south without starving.,1,6,18
11263,davos, m,davos," Thank you, Ser Alliser. We’ll discuss amongst ourselves and come back to you with an answer.",1,6,16
11264,davos, m,davos," Boys, I’ve been running from men like that ll my life. In my learned opinion, we open that door --",1,6,20
11265,davos, m,davos," Aye, but we don’t need to make it easy for them.",1,6,11
11266,davos, m,davos, There’s always the Red Woman.,1,6,5
11267,davos, m,davos, You haven’t seen her do what I’ve seen her do.,1,6,10
11268,davos, m,davos," Aside from the Starks and the Boltons, the most powerful houses in the North are the Umbers, the Karstarks, and the Manderlys.",5,6,22
11269,davos, m,davos," The Umbers and the Karstarks have already declared for the Boltons, so we’re not doing so well there.",5,6,18
11270,davos, m,davos," I beg your pardon, my lady, but they know that a Stark beheaded their father. I don’t think we can count on them either.",5,6,24
11271,davos, m,davos," Precious little, my lady.",5,6,4
11272,davos, m,davos," They may well be loyal, but how many rose up against the Boltons when they betrayed your family? I may not know the North, but I know men. They’re more or less the same in any corner of the world and even the bravest of them don’t want to see their wives and children skinned for a lost cause. If Jon’s going to convince them to fight alongside him, they need to believe it’s a fight they can win.",5,6,79
11273,davos, m,davos, I don’t doubt it. But Jon doesn’t have the Stark name.,5,6,11
11274,davos, m,davos, I didn’t know the Tullys still had an army.,5,6,9
11275,davos, m,davos," That’s good. The Blackfish is a legend. His support would mean a great deal. Stark, Tully, a few more houses, almost starts to look like a winning side.",5,6,28
11276,davos, m,davos, My lady.,4,6,2
11277,davos, m,davos, Will you stay here at Castle Black?,4,6,7
11278,davos, m,davos, You serve Jon Snow now?,4,6,5
11279,davos, m,davos," Forgive me, my lady, I thought that was Stannis.",4,6,9
11280,davos, m,davos, What happened down there?,4,6,4
11281,davos, m,davos, And Shireen? What happened to the princess?,4,6,7
11282,davos, m,davos," My lady, I’m Ser Davos Seaworth.",4,6,6
11283,davos, m,davos, That’s in the past now.,4,6,5
11284,davos, m,davos, Who did?,4,6,2
11285,davos, m,davos," If it please, my lady, I understand how you feel.",7,6,10
11286,davos, m,davos," Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth.",7,6,6
11287,davos, m,davos, You needn’t ask your maester about my house. It’s rather new.,7,6,11
11288,davos, m,davos," You never thought you’d find yourself in your position. Being responsible for so many lives at such a young age. I never thought I’d be in my position. I was a crabber’s son, then I was a smuggler. And now I found myself addressing the lady of a great house in time of war. But I’m here because this isn’t someone else’s war. It’s our war.",7,6,66
11289,davos, m,davos," Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont, made that man his steward. He chose Jon to be his successor because he knew had the courage to do what was right, even if it meant giving his life. Because Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood that the real war isn’t between a few squabbling houses. It’s between the living and the dead. And make no mistake, my lady, the dead are coming.",7,6,70
11290,davos, m,davos," As long as the Boltons hold Winterfell, the North is divided. And a divided North won’t stand a chance against the Night King. You want to protect your people, my lady. I understand. But there’s no hiding from this. We have to fight and we need to do it together.",7,6,50
11291,davos, m,davos," If they’re half as ferocious as their lady, the Boltons are doomed.",7,6,12
11292,davos, m,davos, Stannis camped here on his way to Winterfell.,7,6,8
11293,davos, m,davos, He was the most experienced commander in Westeros. He chose this place for a reason. Those mountains are a natural fortification. There’s a stream down there for the horses.,7,6,29
11294,davos, m,davos," Aye, the snows defeated Stannis as much as the Boltons did.",7,6,11
11295,davos, m,davos, It’s not what we’d hoped for. But we still have a chance if we’re careful and smart.,7,6,17
11296,davos, m,davos, For fuck’s sake.,7,6,3
11297,davos, m,davos," Friends, this is not worth fighting over!",7,6,7
11298,davos, m,davos," This’ll be it, now. Right now, we don’t need to be fighting.",7,6,12
11299,davos, m,davos, Hold on.,7,6,2
11300,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," For which I am extremely grateful to you, my lord.  Lady Arryn and I have known each other since we were children. She has always been positively predisposed toward me.",3,3,30
11301,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Titles do seem to breed titles.,3,3,6
11302,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, I'm surprised you're surprised. This is the safest place in the city.,3,3,12
11303,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," Thank you, my dear.",3,3,4
11304,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, I hear you owe that boy a significant debt.,3,3,9
11305,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, You should have him knighted.,3,3,5
11306,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, If only. I owe you a significant debt. Our redheaded friend. You secured her release when the queen detained her.,3,3,20
11307,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," Apparently, Her Grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship.",3,3,13
11308,littlefinger, m,littlefinger,  I know.,3,3,2
11309,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, I know. But how would the queen get that idea?,3,3,10
11310,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Keep a low profile.,3,3,4
11311,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," Well, you are richer than I am.",3,3,7
11312,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," They're only numbers. Numbers on paper. Once you understand that, it's easy to make them behave. Trivial even. You want a real challenge? Try whores.",3,3,25
11313,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Lovely day for it. Watching the ships.,1,3,7
11314,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Might I speak with Lady Sansa alone for a moment?,1,3,10
11315,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, I saw your mother not long ago. She's very eager to see you. And your sister.,1,3,16
11316,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, You said King's Landing was your home. You are the property of the crown. Stealing you would be treason. If you were to tell just one person ...,1,3,28
11317,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, How do I know?,1,3,4
11318,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," I'm waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital. When I set sail, I might be able to take you with me. But you'll need to be ready to leave on a moment's notice.",1,3,41
11319,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Your Grace.,5,3,2
11320,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," Of course, Your Grace.",5,3,4
11321,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, I see. And have you shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin?,5,3,11
11322,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," Myself, I often find them a hindrance.",5,3,7
11323,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, I shall do my best.,5,3,5
11324,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, I assure you that it will.,5,3,6
11325,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, That didn't take long.,5,3,4
11326,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Is he? And who's the lucky girl?,5,3,7
11327,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," She may not be the grandest ship in the world or the fastest, but she's mine. I've always wanted a ship. Now I want a dozen. Strange, isn't it?",5,3,29
11328,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," It doesn't matter what we want, once we get it, then we want something else. Your hair is different.",5,3,19
11329,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Lady Margaery wears it that way.,5,3,6
11330,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, I have good news. I'll be leaving the city soon.,5,3,10
11331,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," It's not a question of what I want. It's what you want. You want to go home, don't you?",5,3,19
11332,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," I hope you know that I'm your friend, Sansa. Your true friend.",5,3,12
11333,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Petyr.,5,3,1
11334,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," If you wish to stay, then of course you will stay.",5,3,11
11335,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, We'll speak again when I return.,5,3,6
11336,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, There aren't There aren't even 200. I've counted.,6,3,8
11337,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," Early days, my friend. It is flattering, really you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want.",6,3,21
11338,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," You're so right. For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells. If I'm going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there. But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect, you didn't bring her any enjoyment. And she didn't bring me any enjoyment. She was a bad investment on my part. Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new. Something daring. And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience.",6,3,96
11339,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, The realm? Do you know what the realm is? It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies. A story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that it's a lie.,6,3,34
11340,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder.,6,3,8
11341,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, (voice over) Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them.,6,3,19
11342,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," (voice over) And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse. They cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is.",6,3,35
11343,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," Petyr... Are you hurt, my lady?",3,4,6
11344,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Good. Good. I'm sure you've had quite a fright. Rest easy. The worst is past.  Ser Dontos shouts up from his boat.,3,4,22
11345,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," Softly, my friend... Voices carry over water.",3,4,7
11346,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," Shh. You don't want the queen to hear, do you? 1,000 gold cloaks are searching for you. And if they found you, how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the king?",3,4,35
11347,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," I know. I know. But you must admit it looks suspicious. The king who executed your father, who tormented you for years, and you fled the scene of his murder.",3,4,30
11348,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Because he was a drunk and a fool and I don't trust drunk fools.,3,4,14
11349,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," Saved you? My lady, he followed my orders. Every one of them. And he did it all for gold. Money buys a man's silence for a time. A bolt in the heart buys it forever.",3,4,35
11350,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," Yes, and he gave you a priceless necklace that once belonged to his grandmother. The last legacy of House Hollard.",3,4,20
11351,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, I had it made a few weeks ago. What did I once tell you about the capital?,3,4,17
11352,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," Come, my lady. I know you've had a difficult day. But you're safe now. I promise you that. You're safe with me and sailing home.",3,4,25
11353,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Pull up your hood. A memorable shade.,5,4,7
11354,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, You know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most? Ones about rich girls they'll never meet.,5,4,18
11355,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," The mountains are impassable. If you want to get to the Eyrie, you need to go through the Bloody Gate. It doesn't matter how large your army is, if you attack this gate, you do it on this road, three men abreast and get slaughtered like goats. The first Lords of the Vale didn't have much, but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them. And the fortress they built here has never been overcome. Not once in 1,000 years. Know your strengths, use them wisely, and one man can be worth 10,000.",5,4,96
11356,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Lord Petyr Baelish and his niece Alayne.,5,4,7
11357,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, My lord.,5,4,2
11358,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Oh. I have brought you a gift.,5,4,7
11359,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, My lady.,5,4,2
11360,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Go. We'll speak soon.,5,4,4
11361,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," Arranging for the ascension of King Tommen I, extricating Sansa, getting her here alive.",5,4,14
11362,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Ought we not... inform the Lords of the Vale about the ceremony?,5,4,12
11363,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, I do think that we could wait until...,5,4,8
11364,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Like it was yesterday.,5,4,4
11365,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, The deed is done. Faded into nothing. Only speaking of it can make it real.,5,4,15
11366,littlefinger, m,littlefinger,"  Tonight it is, then.",5,4,4
11367,littlefinger, m,littlefinger,"  Let me bathe and dress for the occasion. Once I'm presentable, I'll call on the septon immediately.",5,4,17
11368,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, I'm getting married to your Aunt Lysa. She's waiting for us at the Eyrie. You'll be safe there.,4,4,18
11369,littlefinger, m,littlefinger,Did I kill Joffrey? I've been in the Vale for weeks.,4,4,11
11370,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, And who helped me with this conspiracy?,4,4,7
11371,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Why not?,4,4,2
11372,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Then perhaps it was your husband.,4,4,6
11373,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, How do you know?,4,4,4
11374,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, You're right. He wasn't involvedi n Joffrey's death. But you were. Do you remember that lovely necklace Dontos gave you? I don't suppose you noticed that a stone was missing after the feast.,4,4,33
11375,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," A man with no motive is a man no one suspects. Always keep your foes confused. If they don't know who you are or what you want, they can't know what you plan to do next.",4,4,36
11376,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, So many men they risk so little. They spend their lives avoiding danger. And then they die. I'd risk everything to get what I want.,4,4,25
11377,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," Everything. My friendship with the Lannisters was productive. But Joffrey, a vicious boy with a crown on his head, is not a reliable ally. And who could trust a friend like that?",4,4,32
11378,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," I don't want friends like me. My new friends are predictable. Very reasonable people. As for what happened to Joffrey, well, that was something my new friends wanted very badly. Nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong.",4,4,42
11379,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Children.,7,4,1
11380,littlefinger, m,littlefinger,"  Yes, I saw.",7,4,3
11381,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," No, his mother should have a long time ago. Consider it a step in the right direction.",7,4,17
11382,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Let me worry about Aunt Lysa.,7,4,6
11383,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," A lot can happen between now and never. If you want to build a better home, first you must demolish the old one.",7,4,23
11384,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," I loved your mother more than you could ever know. Given the opportunity, what do we do to those who've hurt the ones we love? In a better world, one where love could overcome strength and duty, you might have been my child. But we don't live in that world.",7,4,50
11385,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, You're more beautiful than she ever was.,7,4,7
11386,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Call me Petyr.,7,4,3
11387,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Lysa! Let her go.,7,4,4
11388,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Let her go.,7,4,3
11389,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," I'll send her away. I swear on my life. I swear to all the gods. Let her go, Lysa.",7,4,19
11390,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," Oh, my sweet wife. My sweet, silly wife.",7,4,8
11391,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," I have only loved one woman... only one, my entire life. Your sister.",7,4,13
11392,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," You honor me beyond words, Your Grace. I shall have to acquire some sons and grandsons.  The crowd laughs",10,2,19
11393,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, My lady. My sincerest condolences.,10,2,5
11394,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," You shouldn't say that. You'll be good enough for many things. He'll still enjoy beating you. And now that you're a woman, he'll be able to enjoy you in other ways as well.",10,2,33
11395,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," He'll let you go home? Joffrey's not the sort of boy who gives away his toys. You have a tender heart, just like your mother did at your age. I can see so much of her in you. She was like a sister to me. For her sake, I'll help get you home.",10,2,53
11396,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Look around you. We're all liars here. And every one of us is better than you.,10,2,16
11397,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Tell no one what?,3,2,4
11398,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, She imprisoned you. She tried to execute you. And you offer her son a princess?,3,2,15
11399,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, And I suppose you want me to broker this agreement?,3,2,10
11400,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to. What's in it for me?",3,2,17
11401,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Harrenhal is cursed.,3,2,3
11402,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," With a single stroke, you'd make me one of the greatest lords in the realm.",3,2,15
11403,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," So did Janos Slynt, and he was given Harrenhal, too. Until you snatched it away.",3,2,15
11404,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, (Nods.),3,2,1
11405,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, The Queen mustn't know.,3,2,4
11406,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," I don't appreciate being made a fool of, dwarf. If Myrcella marries the Martell boy, she can't very well marry Robin Arryn, can she?",3,2,24
11407,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," And Harrenhal, I suppose that's off the table as well.",3,2,10
11408,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Leave me out of your next deception.,3,2,7
11409,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer.,3,2,7
11410,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," My lord, my lady.",5,2,4
11411,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," Stannis will be here in an hour. When he arrives, Renly's bannermen will flock to him. Your former companions will fight for the privilege of selling you to their new king.",5,2,31
11412,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," You will note that I am standing here talking to you, not Stannis.",5,2,13
11413,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Stannis.,5,2,1
11414,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," Tell me, Ser Loras, what do you desire most in this world?",5,2,12
11415,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," I have always found that to be the purest of motivations, but you won't have a chance to put your sword through Stannis, not today. You'll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground. If it is justice that you want, be smart about it.",5,2,48
11416,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," He was, Your Grace.",5,2,4
11417,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Do you want to be a queen?,5,2,7
11418,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Your Grace.,4,2,2
11419,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, I'm a practical man.,4,2,4
11420,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, And who would you have me be loyal to? Your brother's corpse?,4,2,12
11421,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," You still have many friends at court, Your Grace, many who believe Ned Stark erred by not supporting your claim.",4,2,20
11422,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, I would give priority to my head.,4,2,7
11423,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," I understand that you don't like me, and while that saddens me greatly, I did not come here today seeking your affection. When you march on King's Landing, you may find yourself facing a protracted siege or open gates.",4,2,39
11424,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Your Grace.,4,2,2
11425,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, All of these tents look the same to me. -Would you be so kind,4,2,14
11426,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," ""Your tent""? Not ""Our tent""? The king snores, perhaps? Or simply prefers solitude? Pressures of command, no doubt. Four kings vying for the throne.",4,2,24
11427,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," If war were arithmetic, the mathematicians would rule the world. I did notice your brother entering His Grace's tent just now.",4,2,21
11428,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," And on the night of your wedding, who was by the king's side then?",4,2,14
11429,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," Your marriage is quite interesting. Not only to me, but to the realm. The marriage of a wealthy girl always breeds interest, if nothing else.",4,2,25
11430,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," I've been unlucky in my affections, sadly.",4,2,7
11431,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, You may have heard false reports.,4,2,6
11432,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Betrayed? I wanted him to serve as Protector of the Realm. I begged him to seize the moment.,4,2,18
11433,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," No, my lady.",4,2,3
11434,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," Cat, I've I've loved you since I was a boy. It seems to me that fate has given us this chance",4,2,21
11435,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," Do you want to see your girls again? Sansa, more beautiful than ever? And Arya, just as wild as ever?",4,2,20
11436,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Both girls are healthy and safe. For now. But you know the Queen and you know Joffrey. I fear for their longevity if they remain in the capital.,4,2,28
11437,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, The Lannisters will trade your daughters for the Kingslayer.,4,2,9
11438,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, I'm not bringing these terms to him. I'm bringing them to you.,4,2,12
11439,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," Robb has surprised them all with his skills in battle, but he's not a mother. Consider it, Cat. You may not get another chance. I've brought you a gift.",4,2,29
11440,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Your husband was an honorable man. He should rest beside his family in the crypts beneath Winterfell. You may not believe,4,2,21
11441,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Lord Tywin.,6,2,2
11442,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Thank you.,6,2,2
11443,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, I traveled here directly from Renly Baratheon's camp.,6,2,8
11444,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, So they say. There has been talk of other forces at work. Dark forces.,6,2,14
11445,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, It is my belief that a moment of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after.,6,2,14
11446,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, The Tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings. Loras wants revenge. He blames Stannis for Renly's death. And Margaery,6,2,23
11447,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," Yes, she does.",6,2,3
11448,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," They did. And perhaps that treason should be punished one day, after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated.",6,2,18
11449,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, They have.,6,2,2
11450,littlefinger, m,littlefinger,  It's only wine.,6,2,3
11451,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," Tonight, with your leave.",6,2,4
11452,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," On your son Tyrion's directive, I met with Catelyn Stark.",6,2,10
11453,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, He had an interesting proposal for her concerning her daughters.,6,2,10
11454,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, It's not easy for ravens to fly in these storms. Perhaps Jon tried to send word earlier.,7,7,17
11455,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, I can't believe he'd surrender the Northern crown without consulting you.,7,7,11
11456,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, I've heard gossip that the Dragon Queen is quite beautiful.,7,7,10
11457,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Jon is young and unmarried. Daenerys is young and unmarried.,7,7,10
11458,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," An alliance makes sense. Together, they'd be difficult to defeat. He was named King.",7,7,14
11459,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," You are family, too. Would Arya really murder her own sister?",7,7,11
11460,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," Only by reputation. They worship the God of Death, I believe. I never trust godly men.",7,7,16
11461,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, She's your sister,7,7,3
11462,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Why did she come to Winterfell?,7,7,6
11463,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Why did she unearth the letter Cersei made you write?,7,7,10
11464,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," And after she murders you, what does she become?",7,7,9
11465,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," Lady Sansa, forgive me I'm a bit confused.",7,7,8
11466,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, I did it to protect you.,7,7,6
11467,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Whatever your aunt,7,7,3
11468,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, I know of no such letter.,7,7,6
11469,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, I deny it! None of you were there to see what happened. None of you knows the truth.,7,7,18
11470,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," Lady Sansa, I have known you since you were a girl. I've protected you.",7,7,14
11471,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," If we could speak alone, I can explain everything.",7,7,9
11472,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," Sansa, please.",7,7,2
11473,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Give me a chance to defend myself. I deserve that.,7,7,10
11474,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, I am Lord Protector of the Vale and I command you to escort me safely back to the Eyrie.,7,7,19
11475,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," Sansa, I beg you! I loved your mother since the time I was a boy.",7,7,15
11476,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, I loved you. More than anyone.,7,7,6
11477,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Sansa! (GASPS) I--,7,7,3
11478,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," Sansa. Lady Brienne. When I heard you had escaped WInterfell, I feared the worst. You have no idea how happy I am to see you unharmed.",5,6,26
11479,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, I rode north with the Knights of the Vale to come to your aid. They’re encamped at Moat Cailin as we speak.,5,6,22
11480,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, I can’t begin to contemplate --,5,6,6
11481,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, He beat you.,5,6,3
11482,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," Sansa, I --",5,6,3
11483,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Did he cut you?,5,6,4
11484,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, I didn’t know.,5,6,3
11485,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," I made a mistake, a horrible mistake. I underestimated a stranger.",5,6,11
11486,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, I’m so sorry.,5,6,3
11487,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, And I will. You must believe me when I tell you that I will.,5,6,14
11488,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," Do you want me to beg for my life? If that’s what you want, I will. Whatever you ask that is in my power, I will do.",5,6,27
11489,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Then I will die.,5,6,4
11490,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, I would do anything to undo what’s been done to you. I know that I can’t. Will you allow me to say one more thing before I go? Your great-uncle Brynden the Blackfish has gathered what remains of the Tully forces and retaken Riverrun. You might consider seeking him out. The time may come when you need an army loyal to you.,5,6,62
11491,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Your brother’s army.,5,6,3
11492,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Half-brother.,5,6,1
11493,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, The Defender of the Vale!,4,6,5
11494,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, My lord. Come and see.,4,6,5
11495,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, I missed your name day. Go on.,4,6,7
11496,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, A gyrfalcon. The greatest and rarest of birds.,4,6,8
11497,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Indeed I was.,4,6,3
11498,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," On our way to the Fingers, we were set upon by a large force of Bolton men. Seemed to know exactly when we were traveling and exactly whom we were transporting.",4,6,31
11499,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," Tell me, Lord Royce, how many people knew of my travel plans with Sansa Stark? I shared my intentions with you and no one else.",4,6,25
11500,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Your home is the Vale. The Lord of the Vale stands before us. And only his judgment concerns me.,4,6,19
11501,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," Lord Royce has served the Vale well. He;s enjoyed a distinguished military career. If we could trust his absolute loyalty, he would make a capable commander in the wars to come.",4,6,31
11502,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, I think he deserves one more chance. What do you say?,4,6,11
11503,littlefinger, m,littlefinger," I bring good news. My friends in the North tell me Sansa has escaped Winterfell. I expect she’s headed to Castle Black where her brother serves as Lord Commander. But she won’t be safe there, not with the Boltons after her.",4,6,41
11504,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, That was my instinct as well.,4,6,6
11505,littlefinger, m,littlefinger, Our lord has spoken. Gather the Knights of the Vale. The time has come to join the fray.,4,6,18
11506,daenerys, f,daenerys, Where?,9,3,1

11513,daenerys, f,daenerys, How many?,8,3,2
11514,daenerys, f,daenerys, Enough to make a difference?,8,3,5
11515,daenerys, f,daenerys,  It's hard to collect wages from a corpse. I'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side.,8,3,19
11516,daenerys, f,daenerys, I'd like to talk to the Titan's Bastard about winning.,8,3,10

11733,daenerys, f,daenerys, So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family?,8,5,16
11734,daenerys, f,daenerys, If you’d rather return to the fighting pits just say the word.,8,5,12
11735,daenerys, f,daenerys, And why are you worth meeting? Why should I spend my time listening to you?,8,5,15
11736,daenerys, f,daenerys, I have a very large army and very large dragons.,8,5,10
11737,daenerys, f,daenerys, So you want to advise me. Very well. (looks to Jorah) What would you have me do with him? I swore I would kill him if he ever returned.,8,5,29
11738,daenerys, f,daenerys, Why should the people trust a queen who can’t keep her promises?,8,5,12
11739,daenerys, f,daenerys," Yes, many opportunities.",8,5,3
11740,daenerys, f,daenerys, No. Not until forced to do so.,8,5,7
11741,daenerys, f,daenerys, So I should kill him?,8,5,5
11742,daenerys, f,daenerys, Remove Ser Jorah from the city.,8,5,6
11743,daenerys, f,daenerys, So have you decided yet? Whether I’m worthy of your service?,8,5,11
11744,daenerys, f,daenerys, It’s probably my safest option.,8,5,5
11745,daenerys, f,daenerys, And what would your father do?,8,5,6
11746,daenerys, f,daenerys, Is that why you killed him?,8,5,6
11747,daenerys, f,daenerys, I know what my father was. What he did. I know the Mad King earned his name.,8,5,17
11748,daenerys, f,daenerys, I’m terrible?,8,5,2
11749,daenerys, f,daenerys, Which kind is that?,8,5,4
11750,daenerys, f,daenerys, I did reopen the fighting pits. Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment.,8,5,15
11751,daenerys, f,daenerys, Perhaps it won’t come to that.,8,5,6
11752,daenerys, f,daenerys, Varys? King Robert’s spy master?,8,5,5
11753,daenerys, f,daenerys, Jorah sent my secrets to Varys. For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.,8,5,19
11754,daenerys, f,daenerys, But you trust him?,8,5,4
11755,daenerys, f,daenerys, The brother who killed my father.,8,5,6
11756,daenerys, f,daenerys, Perhaps I will have you killed after all.,8,5,8
11757,daenerys, f,daenerys, I’m not going to kill you.,8,5,6
11758,daenerys, f,daenerys, No.,8,5,1
11759,daenerys, f,daenerys, You’re going to advise me. (takes his wine cup) While you can still speak in complete sentences.,8,5,17
11760,daenerys, f,daenerys, How to get what I want.,8,5,6
11761,daenerys, f,daenerys, If I want jokes I’ll get myself a proper fool.,8,5,10
11762,daenerys, f,daenerys, I fought so that no child born into Slaver’s Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold. I will continue that fight here and beyond. But this is not my home.,8,5,36
11763,daenerys, f,daenerys, The common people.,8,5,3
11764,daenerys, f,daenerys," Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell. They’re all just spokes on a wheel. This one's on top, then that ones on top and on and on it spins, crushing the people on the ground.",8,5,33
11765,daenerys, f,daenerys, I’m not going to stop the wheel. I’m going to break the wheel.,8,5,13
11766,daenerys, f,daenerys, We have to go home.,10,5,5
11767,daenerys, f,daenerys," My poor, sweet thing. Does it hurt? (pause) We have to go home. Drogon? Can you take me back to Meereen?",10,5,21
11768,daenerys, f,daenerys, How far did you carry me? (surveys the area),10,5,9
11769,daenerys, f,daenerys," Drogon, we need to return. My people need me.",10,5,9
11770,daenerys, f,daenerys," Well, there’s no food. At the very least you can hunt us some supper.",10,5,14
11771,daenerys, f,daenerys, It would send a message.,2,5,5
11772,daenerys, f,daenerys, Why?,2,5,1
11773,daenerys, f,daenerys, Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was.,2,5,18
11774,daenerys, f,daenerys, Thank you all for your counsel.,2,5,6
11775,daenerys, f,daenerys, About what?,2,5,2
11776,daenerys, f,daenerys, The Mad King? You're here to remind me of my enemies' lies? Consider me reminded.,2,5,15
11777,daenerys, f,daenerys, Go on.,2,5,2
11778,daenerys, f,daenerys, I'm not my father.,2,5,4
11779,daenerys, f,daenerys, I will not have the Son of the Harpy executed without a fair trial.,2,5,14
11780,daenerys, f,daenerys, Why?,2,5,1
11781,daenerys, f,daenerys," He was our prisoner, awaiting trial. You had no right.",2,5,10
11782,daenerys, f,daenerys, There are no more slaves. There are no more Masters.,2,5,10
11783,daenerys, f,daenerys," The Harpy's life was not yours to take. Once, the Masters were the law--",2,5,14
11784,daenerys, f,daenerys, The law is the law. Take him.,2,5,7
11785,daenerys, f,daenerys, You opened your gates to me because I promised you freedom and justice. One cannot exist without the other.,2,5,19
11786,daenerys, f,daenerys, A citizen of Meereen was awaiting trial and this man murdered him. The punishment is death.,2,5,16
11787,daenerys, f,daenerys, Leave me.,2,5,2
11788,daenerys, f,daenerys, Drogon...,2,5,1
11789,daenerys, f,daenerys, Sons of the Harpy?,1,5,4
11790,daenerys, f,daenerys, They’ve never killed before.,1,5,4
11791,daenerys, f,daenerys, I didn’t conquer them. Their own people did.,1,5,8
11792,daenerys, f,daenerys," Then they will have to learn to see things differently, Mossador. He did not risk his life fighting for freedom so cowards in masks could take it away. And I did not take up residence in this pyramid so I could watch the city below decline into chaos. What was the name of the man you lost?",1,5,57
11793,daenerys, f,daenerys, I want him buried with honor. Publicly. In the Temple of the Graces.,1,5,13
11794,daenerys, f,daenerys, Angry snakes lash out. Makes chopping off their heads that much easier. Find the men who did this and bring them to me.,1,5,23
11795,daenerys, f,daenerys, Good.,1,5,1
11796,daenerys, f,daenerys, Concessions?,1,5,1
11797,daenerys, f,daenerys, I’m not a politician. I’m a queen.,1,5,7
11798,daenerys, f,daenerys," I don’t expect the Wise Masters to be happy. Slavery made them rich, I ended slavery.",1,5,16
11799,daenerys, f,daenerys, The fighting pits? Where slaves fought slaves to the death?,1,5,10
11800,daenerys, f,daenerys, No fighting pits.,1,5,3
11801,daenerys, f,daenerys, I do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting.,1,5,9
11802,daenerys, f,daenerys, How many times must I say no before you understand?,1,5,10
11803,daenerys, f,daenerys, Whatever he wants from me he’s not going to get it. If he really believes I’m going to reopen the fighting pits…,1,5,22
11804,daenerys, f,daenerys, What?,1,5,1
11805,daenerys, f,daenerys, Why?,1,5,1
11806,daenerys, f,daenerys," You were sold into slavery, forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters, and you’re defending the fighting pits?",1,5,23
11807,daenerys, f,daenerys, That’s why I have the Unsullied patrolling the streets.,1,5,9
11808,daenerys, f,daenerys, I don’t want another child’s bones dropped at my feet. No one’s seen Drogon in weeks. For all I know he’s flown halfway across the world. I can’t control them anymore.,1,5,31
11809,daenerys, f,daenerys, Viserion? Rhaegal?,1,5,2
11810,daenerys, f,daenerys, Easy. Easy. Easy.,1,5,3
11811,daenerys, f,daenerys," ""Barristan the Bold"" they called him. He crossed a continent to serve me. He was a loyal friend. And he died in an alley, butchered by cowards who hide behind masks.",5,5,31
11812,daenerys, f,daenerys, I prefer your earlier suggestion. Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's great families and bring them to me.,5,5,20
11813,daenerys, f,daenerys, (in Valyrian) Walk forward.,5,5,4
11814,daenerys, f,daenerys, (Valyrian) Another step.,5,5,3
11815,daenerys, f,daenerys," (Valyrian) They will eat you, if I tell them to. They may eat you even if I don’t. Children. Some say I should give up on them. (One of the men is mumbling). But a good mother never gives up on her children. She disciplines them if she must.",5,5,49
11816,daenerys, f,daenerys, (Valyrian) But she does not give up on them.,5,5,9
11817,daenerys, f,daenerys," (Valyrian) Who is innocent? Maybe all of you are, (Looks at Hizdahr), maybe none of you are. Maybe, (Touching Hizdahr’s arm), I should let the dragons decide.",5,5,27
11818,daenerys, f,daenerys, Don't want to overfeed them. Tomorrow perhaps.,5,5,7
11819,daenerys, f,daenerys," If I give everyone what they deserve, I'll have no one left to rule. Ser Barristan counseled mercy when I took this city right up to the morning he died. Daario Naharis thinks I should kill the former Masters and let the rest of the city fend for itself. What do you think?",5,5,53
11820,daenerys, f,daenerys, (Sitting down). You are as fit as anyone I know. You know why I'm here. And you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart. So what do you think?,5,5,33
11821,daenerys, f,daenerys," What about ""Valar Morghulis""?",5,5,4
11822,daenerys, f,daenerys," It takes courage to admit fear. And to admit a mistake. I came here to tell you that I was wrong. I was wrong and you were right. About tradition. About bringing the people of this city together. I will reopen the fighting pits. To free men only. Slavery will never return to Meereen, not while I live.",5,5,58
11823,daenerys, f,daenerys," And in order to forge a lasting bond with the Meereenese people, I will marry the leader of an ancient family. (Hizdahr nods). Thankfully a suitor is already on his knees.",5,5,31
11824,daenerys, f,daenerys, Everyone looks happy enough from up here. (Barristan chuckles). What?,4,5,10
11825,daenerys, f,daenerys, Why?,4,5,1
11826,daenerys, f,daenerys, He sang to them?,4,5,4
11827,daenerys, f,daenerys, And what did you do?,4,5,5
11828,daenerys, f,daenerys, He was good?,4,5,3
11829,daenerys, f,daenerys, He told me Rhaegar was good at killing people. (Sits down).,4,5,11
11830,daenerys, f,daenerys, And what did you do with the money?,4,5,8
11831,daenerys, f,daenerys, How many others are there?,4,5,5
11832,daenerys, f,daenerys," Will you be joining us, Ser Barristan?",4,5,7
11833,daenerys, f,daenerys," I think I can protect me from Hizdahr Zo Loraq. Go, Ser Barristan. Sing a song for me.",4,5,18
11834,daenerys, f,daenerys, Is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport?,4,5,18
11835,daenerys, f,daenerys, I do not recognize this tradition.,4,5,6
11836,daenerys, f,daenerys, Don’t be ridiculous. My marriage to Hizdahr is political. I think he’s smart enough to understand that.,7,5,17
11837,daenerys, f,daenerys, Are you jealous?,7,5,3
11838,daenerys, f,daenerys, I do.,7,5,2
11839,daenerys, f,daenerys," You told me yourself, I can’t fight enemies within and without. So when enemies from without come knocking, I need the city of Mereen behind me. I have no choice.",7,5,30
11840,daenerys, f,daenerys, So what else can I do?,7,5,6
11841,daenerys, f,daenerys," Even if I wanted to do such an inadviseable thing, I couldn’t.",7,5,12
11842,daenerys, f,daenerys, No. I can’t,7,5,3
11843,daenerys, f,daenerys, Of course,7,5,2
11844,daenerys, f,daenerys, I am a queen. Not a butcher.,7,5,7
11845,daenerys, f,daenerys, Sitting through the great games will be bad enough.,7,5,9
11846,daenerys, f,daenerys, I think I’ve seen enough.,7,5,5
11847,daenerys, f,daenerys, I’ve sacrificed more than enough for your traditions.,7,5,8
11848,daenerys, f,daenerys, Get him out of my sight.,7,5,6
11849,daenerys, f,daenerys, Who are you?,7,5,3
11850,daenerys, f,daenerys, Astapor?,8,2,1
11851,daenerys, f,daenerys, They have my dragons. A mother does not flee without her children.,8,2,12
11852,daenerys, f,daenerys, You should sail to Astapor. I'm sure you'll be safe there.,8,2,11
11853,daenerys, f,daenerys," Then serve me. If my dragons are in the House of the Undying, then take me there.",8,2,17
11854,daenerys, f,daenerys,  And what of my magic? You saw me step into the fire. You watched the witch burn. What did the flames do to me? Do you remember?,8,2,27
11855,daenerys, f,daenerys, They are my children. And they are the only children I will ever have. Take me to them.,8,2,18
11856,daenerys, f,daenerys, Let them try.,10,2,3
11857,daenerys, f,daenerys, Is this a riddle?,10,2,4
11858,daenerys, f,daenerys, Are you trying to frighten me with magic tricks? You want me? Here I am. Are you afraid of a little girl?,10,2,22
11859,daenerys, f,daenerys," (dothraki)  This is dark magic, like the magic that took you from me. Took you from me before I could even Maybe I am dead and I just don't know it yet. Maybe I am with you in the Night Lands.",10,2,41
11860,daenerys, f,daenerys, That sounds like something you would do.,10,2,7
11861,daenerys, f,daenerys," Until the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, until the rivers run dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves.",10,2,26
11862,daenerys, f,daenerys," This is not my home. My home is across the sea, where my people are waiting for me.",10,2,18
11863,daenerys, f,daenerys, Dracarys.,10,2,1
11864,daenerys, f,daenerys, Come.,10,2,1
11865,daenerys, f,daenerys, Nothing.,10,2,1
11866,daenerys, f,daenerys," Thank you, Xaro Xhoan Daxos. Thank you for teaching me this lesson.",10,2,12
11867,daenerys, f,daenerys, Looks real enough to me. Real enough to buy a ship?,10,2,11
11868,daenerys, f,daenerys, Does it ever end?,2,2,4
11869,daenerys, f,daenerys," (Speaking Dothraki) Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro.. Take our remaining horses. Find out how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side.",2,2,26
11870,daenerys, f,daenerys, He is blood of my blood.,2,2,6
11871,daenerys, f,daenerys, Who did this?,2,2,3
11872,daenerys, f,daenerys, They will like it far less when I'm done with them.,2,2,11
11873,daenerys, f,daenerys, (Speaking Dothraki) Shh. They cannot kill his soul.,2,2,8
11874,daenerys, f,daenerys, (Speaking Dothraki) Shh. We will build him a funeral pyre.,2,2,10
11875,daenerys, f,daenerys," (Speaking Dothraki) And I promise you, Rakharo will ride with his ancestors tonight.",2,2,13
11876,daenerys, f,daenerys, He said they ate meat.,1,2,5
11877,daenerys, f,daenerys, My brother didn't know anything about dragons. He didn't know anything about anything.,1,2,13
11878,daenerys, f,daenerys, She was Drogo's first gift to me.,1,2,7
11879,daenerys, f,daenerys, I promised to protect them. Promised them their enemies would die screaming. How do I make starvation scream?,1,2,18
11880,daenerys, f,daenerys, Does it ever end?,1,2,4
11881,daenerys, f,daenerys, And you're sure there's no other way?,1,2,7
11882,daenerys, f,daenerys, No one will take my dragons.,1,2,6

11902,daenerys, f,daenerys, That's not the kind of queen I'm going to be.,5,2,10
11903,daenerys, f,daenerys, What is the House of the Undying?,5,2,7
11904,daenerys, f,daenerys, He's not my manservant and he's not in love with me. He's my advisor and he's my friend.,5,2,18
11905,daenerys, f,daenerys, And what about what a woman wants?,5,2,7
11906,daenerys, f,daenerys, To cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne.,5,2,11
11907,daenerys, f,daenerys, Because I promised my khalasar I'd protect them and find them a safe home.,5,2,14
11908,daenerys, f,daenerys, I want them because they're mine by right. The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it.,5,2,18

11948,daenerys, f,daenerys, My birthright. The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.,6,2,7
11949,daenerys, f,daenerys, I'm not asking you for the kingdoms. I'm asking you for ships.,6,2,12
11950,daenerys, f,daenerys, Whatever you grant me now will be repaid three times over when I retake the Iron Throne.,6,2,17
11951,daenerys, f,daenerys," My father sat there, before he was murdered.",6,2,8
11952,daenerys, f,daenerys, I didn't come here to argue grammar.,6,2,7
11953,daenerys, f,daenerys, Not yet.,6,2,2
11954,daenerys, f,daenerys, There are many there that support my claim.,6,2,8
11955,daenerys, f,daenerys, I left when I was a baby.,6,2,7
11956,daenerys, f,daenerys, The people will rise to fight for their rightful queen when I return.,6,2,13
11957,daenerys, f,daenerys," Do you know lllyrio Mopatis, Magister of Pentos? Yes, we've met.",6,2,11
11958,daenerys, f,daenerys," For my wedding, he gave me three petrified dragon eggs. He believed The world believed that the ages had turned them to stone. How many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies? But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs into a great fire, they would hatch. When I stepped into the fire, my own people thought I was mad. But when the fire burned out, I was unhurt, the Mother of Dragons.",6,2,76
11959,daenerys, f,daenerys, Do you understand? I'm no ordinary woman. My dreams come true.,6,2,11
11960,daenerys, f,daenerys," I am not your little princess. I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of Old Valyria, and I will take what is mine. With fire and blood, I will take it.",6,2,31
11961,daenerys, f,daenerys, The Spice King refuses me because I'm a bad investment. The Silk King won't support me because of his business with the Lannisters. Why offend his best customer? And the Copper King offers me a single ship on the condition that I lie with him for a night. Does he think I will whore myself for a boat?,6,2,58
11962,daenerys, f,daenerys, You are one of the Thirteen.,7,2,6
11963,daenerys, f,daenerys, Nothing? They're more valuable than anything in the world.,7,2,9
11964,daenerys, f,daenerys," There is no we, so why would you help me get them back?",7,2,13
11965,daenerys, f,daenerys, But it did happen under your roof.,7,2,7
11966,daenerys, f,daenerys, I don't care where you've been.,7,2,6
11967,daenerys, f,daenerys, You came back.,7,2,3
11968,daenerys, f,daenerys, Irri is dead.,7,2,3
11969,daenerys, f,daenerys, She's dead. She died alone. She died for me and I couldn't protect her.,7,2,14
11970,daenerys, f,daenerys," We can't find her. She must be dead, too. I led my people out of the Red Waste and into the slaughterhouse.",7,2,22
11971,daenerys, f,daenerys, You went to find me a ship.,7,2,7
11972,daenerys, f,daenerys," ""These people""?",7,2,2
11973,daenerys, f,daenerys," And who is to be trusted? Who are my people? The Targaryens? I only knew one, my brother, and he would have let a thousand men rape me if it had got him the crown. The Dothraki? Most of them turned on me the day that Khal Drogo fell from his horse.",7,2,52
11974,daenerys, f,daenerys, The people in Westeros don't know I'm alive.,7,2,8
11975,daenerys, f,daenerys, And then what? They'll pray for my return? They'll wave dragon banners and shout my name? That's what my brother believed and he was a fool.,7,2,26
11976,daenerys, f,daenerys, You are not your brother.,7,2,5
11977,daenerys, f,daenerys," There it is. ""Trust me. "" And it's you I should trust, Ser Jorah? Only you? I don't need trust any longer. I don't want it and I don't have room for it.",7,2,33
11978,daenerys, f,daenerys, And you are too familiar.,7,2,5
11979,daenerys, f,daenerys, Find my dragons.,7,2,3
11980,daenerys, f,daenerys," Please, they're my children. I'm begging you.",7,2,7
11981,daenerys, f,daenerys," Without me, the dragons will die.",7,2,6
11982,daenerys, f,daenerys,  How?,7,2,1
11983,daenerys, f,daenerys, You have my dragons?,7,2,4
11984,daenerys, f,daenerys,  But there is no King of Qarth.,7,2,7
11985,daenerys, f,daenerys,"  Thank you for traveling so far, My Lords.  I hope the seas weren't too rough.",3,7,15
11986,daenerys, f,daenerys,  Forgive me --,3,7,3
11987,daenerys, f,daenerys,"  Forever.  So I assume, My Lord, that you're here to bend the knee.",3,7,13
11988,daenerys, f,daenerys,"  Oh.  Well, that is unfortunate.  You've travelled all this way to break faith with House Targaryen?",3,7,16
11989,daenerys, f,daenerys,"  My father was an evil man.  On behalf of House Targaryen I ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family.  And I ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father.  Our two houses were allies for centuries.  Those were the best centuries the kingdom's ever known.  Centuries of peace and prosperity with the Targaryens sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North.  I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow.  Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine.  Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North.  Together we will save this country from those who would destroy it.",3,7,115
11990,daenerys, f,daenerys,  Then why are you here?,3,7,5
11991,daenerys, f,daenerys,  Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?,3,7,10
11992,daenerys, f,daenerys,"  And did you see the Dothraki, all of whom have sworn to kill for me?",3,7,15
11993,daenerys, f,daenerys,"  But still, I need your help?",3,7,6
11994,daenerys, f,daenerys,"  Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help.",3,7,9
11995,daenerys, f,daenerys,  You told me you liked this man.,3,7,7
11996,daenerys, f,daenerys,"  In the time since he's met me he's refused to call me queen, he's refused to bow and now he's calling me a child.",3,7,24
11997,daenerys, f,daenerys,"  As far as I can see, you are the enemy to the north.",3,7,13
11998,daenerys, f,daenerys,  The dead?,3,7,2
11999,daenerys, f,daenerys,  Is that another figure of speech?,3,7,6
12000,daenerys, f,daenerys,  I was born at Dragonstone.  Not that I can remember it.,3,7,11
12001,daenerys, f,daenerys,"  We fled before Robert's assassins could find us.  Robert was your father's best friend, no?  I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib.  Not that it matters now of course.  I spent my life in foreign lands.  So many men have tried to kill me.  I don't remember all of their names.  I have been sold like a brood mare.  I have been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled.  Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile?  Faith.  Not in any gods.  Not in myths and legends.  In myself.  In Daenerys Targaryen.  The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born.  The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea.  Any sea.",3,7,129
12002,daenerys, f,daenerys,  They did for me.  I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms.  And I will.,3,7,15
12003,daenerys, f,daenerys,"  That's fair.  It's also fair to point out that I'm the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms.  By declaring yourself king of the northern most kingdom, you are in open rebellion.",3,7,31
12004,daenerys, f,daenerys,  You must forgive my manners.  You will both be tired after your long journey.  We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms.,3,7,26
12005,daenerys, f,daenerys,  Not yet.,3,7,2
12006,daenerys, f,daenerys,  And?,3,7,1
12007,daenerys, f,daenerys,  All of them?,3,7,3
12008,daenerys, f,daenerys,  Dragonglass?,3,7,1
12009,daenerys, f,daenerys,  Why are we talking about glass?  We just lost two of our allies.,3,7,13
12010,daenerys, f,daenerys,  And what does the King in the North want with Dragonglass?,3,7,11
12011,daenerys, f,daenerys,  And what do you think of this Army of the Dead and White Walkers and Night Kings?,3,7,17
12012,daenerys, f,daenerys,  Which wise man said this?,3,7,5
12013,daenerys, f,daenerys,  Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?,3,7,11
12014,daenerys, f,daenerys,  What was that Ser Davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people?  Did you notice that?,3,7,20
12015,daenerys, f,daenerys,  I named them for my brothers Vicerys and Rhaegon. They're both gone now.,3,7,13
12016,daenerys, f,daenerys,  You lost two brothers as well?,3,7,6
12017,daenerys, f,daenerys,  People thought dragons were gone forever but here they are.  Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know.,3,7,21
12018,daenerys, f,daenerys,  He is my Hand.,3,7,4
12019,daenerys, f,daenerys,  We all enjoy what we're good at.,3,7,7
12020,daenerys, f,daenerys,  You know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.,3,7,13
12021,daenerys, f,daenerys,  And I haven't changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne.,3,7,13
12022,daenerys, f,daenerys,  I will allow you to mine the Dragonglass and forge weapons from it.  Any resources or men you need I will provide for you.,3,7,24
12023,daenerys, f,daenerys,"  You better get to work, Jon Snow.",3,7,7
12024,daenerys, f,daenerys,  We need to find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.,3,7,10
12025,daenerys, f,daenerys,  I'm not talking about sending our ships after him.,3,7,9
12026,daenerys, f,daenerys,"  I wouldn't be alone.  I'd have Drogon, Vicerion and Rhaegal.  What can anyone do to them?",3,7,16
12027,daenerys, f,daenerys,  What about Casterly Rock?,3,7,4
12028,daenerys, f,daenerys, I wish I could remember it.,2,7,6
12029,daenerys, f,daenerys, I always thought this would be a homecoming. It doesn't feel like home.,2,7,13
12030,daenerys, f,daenerys, Good.,2,7,1
12031,daenerys, f,daenerys, Not so many lions.,2,7,4
12032,daenerys, f,daenerys, They cry out for their true queen? They drink secret toasts to my health?,2,7,14
12033,daenerys, f,daenerys," People used to tell my brother that sort of thing, and he was stupid enough to believe them.",2,7,18
12034,daenerys, f,daenerys," If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back, he'd have invaded King's Landing already.",2,7,17
12035,daenerys, f,daenerys, No.,2,7,1
12036,daenerys, f,daenerys, I never properly thanked you for that.,2,7,7
12037,daenerys, f,daenerys," You served my father, didn't you, Lord Varys?",2,7,8
12038,daenerys, f,daenerys, And then you served the man who overthrew him?,2,7,9
12039,daenerys, f,daenerys, But you didn't serve him long. You turned against him.,2,7,10
12040,daenerys, f,daenerys, So you took it upon yourself to find a better one.,2,7,11
12041,daenerys, f,daenerys," Before I came to power, you favored my brother. All your spies, your little birds, did they tell you Viserys was cruel, stupid, and weak? Would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion?",2,7,38
12042,daenerys, f,daenerys, So you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the Dothraki.,2,7,14
12043,daenerys, f,daenerys, Who gave the order to kill me?,2,7,7
12044,daenerys, f,daenerys, Who hired the assassins?,2,7,4
12045,daenerys, f,daenerys, Who sent word to Essos to murder Daenerys Targaryen?,2,7,9
12046,daenerys, f,daenerys, To keep yourself alive.,2,7,4
12047,daenerys, f,daenerys," Proven himself loyal? Quite the opposite. If he dislikes one monarch, he conspires to crown the next one. What king of a servant is that?",2,7,25
12048,daenerys, f,daenerys," Swear this to me, Varys. If you ever think I'm failing the people, you won't conspire behind my back. You'll look me in the eye as you have done today, and you'll tell me how I'm failing them.",2,7,38
12049,daenerys, f,daenerys," And I swear this--if you ever betray me, I'll burn you alive.",2,7,12
12050,daenerys, f,daenerys,  The Red Priests helped bring peace to Meereen.  You are very welcome here.  What is your name?,2,7,17
12051,daenerys, f,daenerys,  You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone.,2,7,9
12052,daenerys, f,daenerys,  We've just decided to pardon those who served the wrong king.,2,7,11
12053,daenerys, f,daenerys,"  The Lord of Light doesn't have  many followers in Westeros, does he?",2,7,12
12054,daenerys, f,daenerys,  What does your Lord expect from me?,2,7,7
12055,daenerys, f,daenerys,  The prince who was promised will bring the dawn.  I'm afraid I'm not a prince.,2,7,15
12056,daenerys, f,daenerys,"  No, but I like it better.",2,7,6
12057,daenerys, f,daenerys,  And you believe this prophecy refers to me?,2,7,8
12058,daenerys, f,daenerys,  You know him?,2,7,3
12059,daenerys, f,daenerys,  He sounds like quite a man.,2,7,6
12060,daenerys, f,daenerys,  Very well.  Send a raven north.  Tell Jon Snow that his Queen invites him to come to Drangonstone...and bend the knee.,2,7,21
12061,daenerys, f,daenerys,  That's enough.  Tyrion is the Hand of the Queen.  You will treat him with respect.,2,7,15
12062,daenerys, f,daenerys,  I am not here to be queen of the ashes.,2,7,10
12063,daenerys, f,daenerys,"  I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your council.  I'm grateful to all of you.  But you have chosen to follow me.  I will not attack King's Landing.  We will not attack King's Landing.",2,7,34
12064,daenerys, f,daenerys,  We will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides.  Cersei will have the Iron Throne but no food for her army or the people.,2,7,28
12065,daenerys, f,daenerys,  Do I have your support?,2,7,5
12066,daenerys, f,daenerys,"  Thank you all.  Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?",2,7,11
12067,daenerys, f,daenerys,  I realize you're here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me.  But I swear to you she will pay for what she's done and we will bring peace back to Westeros.,2,7,34
12068,daenerys, f,daenerys, Shall we begin?,1,7,3
12069,daenerys, f,daenerys,"  I know what Cersei has told you, that I've come to destroy your cities --",5,7,15
12070,daenerys, f,daenerys,"  Step forward, My Lord.",5,7,4
12071,daenerys, f,daenerys,  You will not kneel?,5,7,4
12072,daenerys, f,daenerys,  You will not trade your honor for your life.  I respect that.,5,7,12
12073,daenerys, f,daenerys,  Who are you?,5,7,3
12074,daenerys, f,daenerys,  I meant what I said.  I'm not here to put men in chains.  If that becomes an option many will take it.  I gave them a choice.  They made it.,5,7,30
12075,daenerys, f,daenerys,  I'm not beheading anyone.,5,7,4
12076,daenerys, f,daenerys,"  Lord Randyll Tarley, Dickon Tarley, I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of my name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons, sentence you to die.",5,7,25
12077,daenerys, f,daenerys,  Dracarys.,5,7,1
12078,daenerys, f,daenerys,"  They're beautiful, aren't they?",5,7,4
12079,daenerys, f,daenerys,"  They're not beasts to me.  No matter how big they get, how terrifying to everyone else, they're my children.",5,7,19
12080,daenerys, f,daenerys,  No.,5,7,1
12081,daenerys, f,daenerys,  And I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday.,5,7,10
12082,daenerys, f,daenerys,  You're not sure how you feel about that?,5,7,8
12083,daenerys, f,daenerys,  How many men did your army kill taking Winterfell back from the Boltons?,5,7,13
12084,daenerys, f,daenerys,  We both want to help people.  We can only help them from a position of strength.  Sometimes strength is terrible.  When you first came here Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people.,5,7,38
12085,daenerys, f,daenerys,  So it was a figure of speech?,5,7,7
12086,daenerys, f,daenerys,  He is my friend.,5,7,4
12087,daenerys, f,daenerys,"  Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont, an old friend.",5,7,10
12088,daenerys, f,daenerys,  You look strong.  You found a cure?,5,7,7
12089,daenerys, f,daenerys,  It would be my honor.,5,7,5
12090,daenerys, f,daenerys,  I'm happy for you.  You don't look happy.,5,7,8
12091,daenerys, f,daenerys,  You said you don't have enough men.,5,7,7
12092,daenerys, f,daenerys,  And give the country to Cersei?  As soon as I march away she marches in.,5,7,15
12093,daenerys, f,daenerys,  I thought that was what we are trying to avoid.,5,7,10
12094,daenerys, f,daenerys,  And how would you get into King's Landing.,5,7,8
12095,daenerys, f,daenerys,"  Well, it will all be for nothing if we don't have one of these dead men.",5,7,16
12096,daenerys, f,daenerys,  I haven't given you permission to leave.,5,7,7
12097,daenerys, f,daenerys,  We should be better at saying farewell by now.,5,7,9
12098,daenerys, f,daenerys,  But I've grown used to him.,5,7,6
12099,daenerys, f,daenerys,  Soon.  They will come back to me.,4,7,7
12100,daenerys, f,daenerys,  What happened?,4,7,2
12101,daenerys, f,daenerys,  Many things?,4,7,2
12102,daenerys, f,daenerys,  It's all right.,4,7,3
12103,daenerys, f,daenerys,  When?,4,7,1
12104,daenerys, f,daenerys,  They were right here standing where we're standing before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters.  Maybe even before there were men.,4,7,22
12105,daenerys, f,daenerys,  Doing what?  Fighting each other?,4,7,5
12106,daenerys, f,daenerys,"  They fought together against their common enemy.  Despite their differences, despite their suspicions, together.  We need to do the same if we're going to survive.",4,7,25
12107,daenerys, f,daenerys,  And you say you can't defeat them without my armies and my dragons?,4,7,13
12108,daenerys, f,daenerys,  I will fight for you.  I will fight for the north...when you bend the knee.,4,7,15
12109,daenerys, f,daenerys,  They will if their king does.  They chose you to lead them.  They chose you to protect them.  Isn't their survival more important than your pride?,4,7,26
12110,daenerys, f,daenerys,  What is it?,4,7,3
12111,daenerys, f,daenerys,  That's very good to hear.,4,7,5
12112,daenerys, f,daenerys,  Isn't it?,4,7,2
12113,daenerys, f,daenerys,  You will stay.  All my allies are gone.  They've been taken from me while I've been sitting here on this island.,4,7,21
12114,daenerys, f,daenerys,  Who won't be able to eat because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach.,4,7,16
12115,daenerys, f,daenerys,"  The right plan?  Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands and the Reach.",4,7,15
12116,daenerys, f,daenerys,"  Our enemies?  Your family, you mean.  Perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all.",4,7,15
12117,daenerys, f,daenerys,  Enough with the clever plans.,4,7,5
12118,daenerys, f,daenerys,  I have three large dragons.  I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.,4,7,14
12119,daenerys, f,daenerys,  My enemies are in the Red Keep.  What kind of a queen am I if I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them?,4,7,25
12120,daenerys, f,daenerys,  What do you think I should do?,4,7,7
12121,daenerys, f,daenerys,  I'm at war.  I'm losing.,4,7,5
12122,daenerys, f,daenerys,  What do you think I should do?,4,7,7
12123,daenerys, f,daenerys,  Dracarys!,4,7,1
12124,daenerys, f,daenerys,  Dracarys!,4,7,1
12125,daenerys, f,daenerys,  Do you know what I like about you?,6,7,8
12126,daenerys, f,daenerys,  You're not a hero.,6,7,4
12127,daenerys, f,daenerys,"  I don't want you to be a hero.  Heroes do stupid things and they die.  Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all try to outdo each other of who can do the stupidist, bravest thing.",6,7,37
12128,daenerys, f,daenerys,  Jon Snow's not in love with me.,6,7,7
12129,daenerys, f,daenerys, My apologies.,7,7,2
12130,daenerys, f,daenerys, Yes. That's all.,7,7,3
12131,daenerys, f,daenerys, Your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with. You have my word.,7,7,16
12132,daenerys, f,daenerys, I didn't believe it until I saw them. I saw them all.,7,7,12
12133,daenerys, f,daenerys," A hundred thousand, at least.",7,7,5
12134,daenerys, f,daenerys, Just the King,7,7,3
12135,daenerys, f,daenerys," I'm grateful for your loyalty, but my dragon died so that we could be here. If it's all for nothing, then he died for nothing.",7,7,25
12136,daenerys, f,daenerys, I didn't come all this way to have my Hand,7,7,10
12137,daenerys, f,daenerys, (Nods),7,7,1
12138,daenerys, f,daenerys," I know. I respect what you did. Wish you hadn't done it, but I respect it.",7,7,16
12139,daenerys, f,daenerys," This place was the beginning of the end for my family. (Speaks Valerian.) A dragon is not a slave. They were terrifying. Extraordinary. They filled people with wonder and awe, and we locked them in here. They wasted away. They grew small. And we grew small as well. We weren't extraordinary without them. We were just like everyone else.",7,7,59
12140,daenerys, f,daenerys, I can't have children.,7,7,4
12141,daenerys, f,daenerys, The witch who murdered my husband.,7,7,6
12142,daenerys, f,daenerys," You were right from the beginning. If I had trusted you, everything would be different.",7,7,15
12143,daenerys, f,daenerys, I can't forget what I saw north of the Wall. And I can't pretend that Cersei won't take back half the country the moment I march north.,7,7,27
12144,daenerys, f,daenerys, (Laughs),7,7,1
12145,daenerys, f,daenerys," And the Unsullied? We can sail with them to White Harbor, meet the Dothraki here on the kingsroad, then ride together to Winterfell.",7,7,23
12146,daenerys, f,daenerys, I've not come to conquer the North. I'm coming to save the North. We sail together.,7,7,16
12147,daenerys, f,daenerys," When I was a child, my brother would tell me a bedtime story about the man who murdered our father.",2,8,20
12148,daenerys, f,daenerys, Who stabbed him in the back and cut his throat. Who sat down on the Iron Throne and watched as his blood poured onto the floor.,2,8,26
12149,daenerys, f,daenerys, He told me other stories as well. About all the things we would do to that man once we took back the Seven Kingdoms and had him in our grasp.,2,8,30
12150,daenerys, f,daenerys, Your sister pledged to send her army north.,2,8,8
12151,daenerys, f,daenerys," I don't see an army. I see one man, with one hand. It appears your sister lied to me.",2,8,19
12152,daenerys, f,daenerys," ""We""?",2,8,1
12153,daenerys, f,daenerys, Like you knew your sister?,2,8,5
12154,daenerys, f,daenerys," Perhaps he trusts his little brother to defend him, right up to the moment he slits my throat.",2,8,18
12155,daenerys, f,daenerys, So why have you abandoned your house and family now?,2,8,10
12156,daenerys, f,daenerys, What does the Warden of the North say about it?,2,8,10
12157,daenerys, f,daenerys, Very well.,2,8,2
12158,daenerys, f,daenerys," Either you knew Cersei was lying and let me believe otherwise, or you didn't know at all. Which makes you either a traitor or a fool.",2,8,26
12159,daenerys, f,daenerys, Not for the first time.,2,8,5
12160,daenerys, f,daenerys," Cersei still sits on the throne. If you can't help me take it back, I'll find another Hand who can.",2,8,20
12161,daenerys, f,daenerys, Have you done something to offend me?,2,8,7
12162,daenerys, f,daenerys, Long ago and long forgiven.,2,8,5
12163,daenerys, f,daenerys," When I named him Hand, I didn't know if I'd ever see you again.",2,8,14
12164,daenerys, f,daenerys, I wasn't under the impression you liked him very much.,2,8,10
12165,daenerys, f,daenerys, He's made mistakes. Serious mistakes.,2,8,5
12166,daenerys, f,daenerys, You're advising me to forgive the man who stole your position?,2,8,11
12167,daenerys, f,daenerys," Lady Sansa, I was hoping we could speak alone.",2,8,9
12168,daenerys, f,daenerys, I thought you and I were on the verge of agreement before. About Ser Jaime.,2,8,15
12169,daenerys, f,daenerys, I wish I could have that kind of faith in my advisors.,2,8,12
12170,daenerys, f,daenerys, I didn't ask him to be my Hand simply because he was good.,2,8,13
12171,daenerys, f,daenerys," I asked him to be my Hand because he was good, and intelligent, and ruthless when he had to be. He never should have trusted Cersei.",2,8,26
12172,daenerys, f,daenerys, I thought he knew his sister.,2,8,6
12173,daenerys, f,daenerys, Ours certainly have been.,2,8,4
12174,daenerys, f,daenerys," We have other things in common. We've both known what it means to lead people who aren't inclined to accept a woman's rule. And we've both done a damn good job of it, from what I can tell.",2,8,38
12175,daenerys, f,daenerys," And yet, I can't help but feel we're at odds with one another. Why is that? Your brother.",2,8,18
12176,daenerys, f,daenerys, That bothers you.,2,8,3
12177,daenerys, f,daenerys," I'm here because I love your brother and I trust him, and I know he's true to his word. He's only the second man in my life I can say that about.",2,8,32
12178,daenerys, f,daenerys, Someone taller.,2,8,2
12179,daenerys, f,daenerys, I take the Iron Throne.,2,8,5
12180,daenerys, f,daenerys, What is it?,2,8,3
12181,daenerys, f,daenerys, Your sister?,2,8,2
12182,daenerys, f,daenerys, But why aren't you with her?,2,8,6
12183,daenerys, f,daenerys, Ser Davos is perfectly capable of waving a torch on his own. You'll be in the crypt.,2,8,17
12184,daenerys, f,daenerys," There are thousands of them and only one of you. You can't fight as well as they can, but you can think better than any of them. You're here because of your mind. If we survive, I'll need it.",2,8,39
12185,daenerys, f,daenerys, Who's that?,2,8,2
12186,daenerys, f,daenerys," My brother, Rhaegar, everyone told me he was decent and kind. He liked to sing. Gave money to poor children. And he raped her.",2,8,24
12187,daenerys, f,daenerys, That's impossible.,2,8,2
12188,daenerys, f,daenerys, Who told you this?,2,8,4
12189,daenerys, f,daenerys, He saw it?,2,8,3
12190,daenerys, f,daenerys, A secret no one in the world knew except your brother and your best friend. Doesn't seem strange to you?,2,8,20
12191,daenerys, f,daenerys," If it were true, it would make you the last male heir of House Targaryen. You'd have a claim to the Iron Throne.",2,8,23
12192,daenerys, f,daenerys," Thank you for inviting us into your home, Lady Stark. The North is as beautiful as your brother claimed, as are you.",1,8,22
12193,daenerys, f,daenerys, Whatever they want.,1,8,3
12194,daenerys, f,daenerys, Your sister doesn't like me.,1,8,5
12195,daenerys, f,daenerys, She doesn't need to be my friend but I am her queen. If she can't respect me-,1,8,17
12196,daenerys, f,daenerys, How many today?,1,8,3
12197,daenerys, f,daenerys, The dragons are barely eating.,1,8,5
12198,daenerys, f,daenerys, They don't like the North.,1,8,5
12199,daenerys, f,daenerys, Go on.,1,8,2
12200,daenerys, f,daenerys, Nobody does. Until they ride a dragon.,1,8,7
12201,daenerys, f,daenerys," Then I've enjoyed your company, Jon Snow.",1,8,7
12202,daenerys, f,daenerys, Whatever you can.,1,8,3
12203,daenerys, f,daenerys, We could stay a thousand years-,1,8,6
12204,daenerys, f,daenerys, No one would find us.,1,8,5
12205,daenerys, f,daenerys, So keep your queen warm.,1,8,5
12206,daenerys, f,daenerys, Don't be afraid.,1,8,3
12207,daenerys, f,daenerys, So you're the man?,1,8,4
12208,daenerys, f,daenerys, The one who saved Ser Jorah when no one else could.,1,8,11
12209,daenerys, f,daenerys, I'll have to make some changes in the Citadel when I take my throne. A great service merits a great reward.,1,8,21
12210,daenerys, f,daenerys," Well, there must be something I could give you.",1,8,9
12211,daenerys, f,daenerys, For what crime?,1,8,3
12212,daenerys, f,daenerys, From the Citadel?,1,8,3
12213,daenerys, f,daenerys, Not Randyll Tarly?,1,8,3
12214,daenerys, f,daenerys, I offered to let him retain his lands and titles if he bent the knee. He refused.,1,8,17
12215,daenerys, f,daenerys, Your brother stood with your father.,1,8,6
12216,daenerys, f,daenerys, Of course.,1,8,2
12217,daenerys, f,daenerys, Gendry.,4,8,1
12218,daenerys, f,daenerys,"THAT'S right, isn't it?",4,8,4
12219,daenerys, f,daenerys, You’re Robert Baratheon’s son.,4,8,4
12220,daenerys, f,daenerys, You are aware he took my family's throne and tried to have me murdered?,4,8,14
12221,daenerys, f,daenerys," Yes, he's dead. His brothers are too. So who's Lord of Storm's End now?",4,8,14
12222,daenerys, f,daenerys, Does anyone?,4,8,2
12223,daenerys, f,daenerys,I think you should be Lord of Storm's End.,4,8,9
12224,daenerys, f,daenerys," No, you are Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End, the lawful son of Robert Baratheon. Because that is what I have made you.",4,8,23
12225,daenerys, f,daenerys,  See? You're not the only one who's clever.,4,8,8
12226,daenerys, f,daenerys," To Arya Stark, the hero of Winterfell!",4,8,7
12227,daenerys, f,daenerys, Are you drunk?,4,8,3
12228,daenerys, f,daenerys, He loved me. And I couldn't love him back. Not the way he wanted. Not the way I love you.,4,8,20
12229,daenerys, f,daenerys, Is that all right?,4,8,4
12230,daenerys, f,daenerys," I wish you'd never told me. If I didn't know, I'd be happy right now.",4,8,15
12231,daenerys, f,daenerys," I try to forget. Tonight I did for a while, and then I saw them gathered around you. I saw the way they looked at you. I know that look. So many people have looked at me that way, but never here. Never on this side of the sea.",4,8,49
12232,daenerys, f,daenerys," (angrily) It doesn't matter what you want. You didn't want to be King in the North. What happens when they demand you press your claim, and take what is mine?",4,8,30
12233,daenerys, f,daenerys," (desperately)You can say nothing. To anyone, ever. Never tell them who you really are. Swear your brother and Samwell Tarly to secrecy, and tell no one else. Or it will take on a life of its own and you won't be able to control it or what it does to people. No matter how many times you bend the knee, no matter what you swear.",4,8,65
12234,daenerys, f,daenerys, I want it to be the way it was between us.,4,8,11
12235,daenerys, f,daenerys, Sansa will want to see me gone and you on the Iron Throne.,4,8,13
12236,daenerys, f,daenerys," She's not the girl you grew up with. Not after what she's seen, not after what they've done to her.",4,8,20
12237,daenerys, f,daenerys, Even if the truth destroys us?,4,8,6
12238,daenerys, f,daenerys, It will. I've never begged for anything but I'm begging you. Don't do this. Please.,4,8,15
12239,daenerys, f,daenerys, We can. I've just told you how.,4,8,7
12240,daenerys, f,daenerys, Cersei will make sure they don't believe it. We will hit her hard. We will rip her out root and stem.,4,8,21
12241,daenerys, f,daenerys," No matter how many lords turn against her, as long as she sits on the Iron Throne, she can call herself Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. We need the capital.",4,8,30
12242,daenerys, f,daenerys, All right.,4,8,2
12243,daenerys, f,daenerys, How long do you suggest?,4,8,5
12244,daenerys, f,daenerys," I came north to fight alongside you at great cost to my armies and myself. Now that the time has come to reciprocate, you want to postpone.",4,8,27
12245,daenerys, f,daenerys,"THE longer I leave my enemies alone, the stronger they become.",4,8,11

12249,daenerys, f,daenerys," Do you believe we're here for a reason, Lord Varys? I'm here to free the world from tyrants. That is my destiny and I will serve it, no matter the cost.",4,8,31
12250,daenerys, f,daenerys," Speaking to Cersei will not prevent a slaughter. But perhaps it's good the people see that Daenerys Stormborn made every effort to avoid bloodshed, and Cersei Lannister refused. They should know whom to blame when the sky falls down upon them.",4,8,41
12251,daenerys, f,daenerys, (in Dothraki) Blood of my blood.,6,8,6
12252,daenerys, f,daenerys, You kept all your promises to me. You killed my enemies in their iron suits.,6,8,15

12262,daenerys, f,daenerys," When I was a girl, my brother told me it was made with 1000 swords from Aegon's fallen enemies. What do 1000 swords look like in the mind of a little girl who can't count to 20? I imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb. So many fallen enemies, you could only see the soles of Aegon's feet.",6,8,60
12263,daenerys, f,daenerys, It was necessary.,6,8,3
12264,daenerys, f,daenerys, I tried to make peace with Cersei. She used their innocence as a weapon against me. She thought it would cripple me.,6,8,22

12266,daenerys, f,daenerys,  I can't.,6,8,2
12267,daenerys, f,daenerys, We can't hide behind small mercies. The world we need won't be built by men loyal to the world we have.,6,8,21
12268,daenerys, f,daenerys,  And it will be. It's not easy to see something that's never been before. A good world.,6,8,17
12269,daenerys, f,daenerys,  Because I know what is good. And so do you.,6,8,10
12270,daenerys, f,daenerys,  You do. You do. You've always known.,6,8,7

12364,daenerys, f,daenerys, It's a gift. I had it made for you.,4,1,9
12365,daenerys, f,daenerys, Please.,4,1,1

12371,daenerys, f,daenerys,"What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?",4,1,7
12372,daenerys, f,daenerys, I pray for home too. My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms. He couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one. He'll never take us home.,4,1,31

12414,daenerys, f,daenerys, Will their ships be enough?,9,6,5

12419,daenerys, f,daenerys, Reasonable.,9,6,1
12420,daenerys, f,daenerys," She’s not demanding, she’s asking. The others are free to ask as well. Our father were evil men, all of us here. They left the world worse than they found it. We’re not going to do that. We’re going to leave the world better than we found it.",9,6,48

12425,daenerys, f,daenerys," You promised me. “My sword is yours. My life is yours.” This is what I command. If I’m going to rule in Westeros, I’ll need to make alliances. The best way to make alliances is with marriage.",10,6,37

12444,daenerys, f,daenerys, You have made a mistake. One you will regret. I am the wife of the Great Khal.,3,6,17

12475,daenerys, f,daenerys, This is where Drogo promised to take his khalasar west to where the world ends. To ride wooden horses across the Black Salt Sea as no khal has done before. He promised to kill the men in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses. He swore to me before the Mother of Mountains.,4,6,55
12476,daenerys, f,daenerys," And here, now, what great matters do the Great Khals discuss? Which little villages you’ll raid, how many girls you’ll get to fuck, how many horses you’ll demand in tribute. You are small men. None of you are fit to lead the Dothraki. But I am. So I will.",4,6,49

12484,daenerys, f,daenerys, Wait here.,6,6,2
12485,daenerys, f,daenerys,  Every khal who ever lived chose three blood riders to fight beside him and guard his way. But I am not a khal. I will not choose three blood riders. I choose you all.,6,6,34
12486,daenerys, f,daenerys, I will ask more of you than any khal has ever asked of his khalassar! Will you ride the wooden horses across the black salt sea?,6,6,26
12487,daenerys, f,daenerys, Will you kill my enemies in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses?,6,6,15

12985,arya, f,arya,"  One time the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick.  I came out here after and Bran had left his bow behind just lying on the ground.  Ser Rodrick would have cuffed him if he saw.  There was one arrow in the target.  There was no one around, just like now.  No one to stop me.  So I started shooting.  And every shot I had to go out there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again.  I wasn't very good.  Finally I hit the bullseye.  It could have been the 20th shot or the 50th.  I don't remember.  But I hit the bullseye and I heard this.",6,7,112
12986,arya, f,arya,  I looked up and he's standing right here smiling down at me.  I knew what I was doing was against the rules.  But he was smiling so I knew it wasn't wrong.  The rules were wrong.  I was doing what I was meant to be doing and he knew it.  Now he's dead.  Killed by the Lannisters with your help.,6,7,60
12987,arya, f,arya,"  That's your pretty handwriting.  Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles because I couldn't write as well as you.  ""Robb, I write to you today with heavy heart.  Our good King Robert is dead.  Killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt --",6,7,44
12988,arya, f,arya,"  ""Father has been charged with treason.  He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne.

12989,arya, f,arya,  Did they.  With a knife at your throat?  Did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop?,6,7,24
12990,arya, f,arya,  So was I.  I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family.,6,7,15
12991,arya, f,arya,  And you were stupid enough to believe them.  I remember you standing on that platform with Joffrey and Cersei when they dragged father too the block.  I remember the pretty dress you were wearing.  I remember the fancy way you did your hair.,6,7,43
12992,arya, f,arya,  I was there standing in the crowd near Baelor's statue.,6,7,10
12993,arya, f,arya,  I wanted to.,6,7,3

13000,arya, f,arya,  Are you scared I'll show it to Jon and he'll be angry?  No.  That's not Jon.  He'll understand.  You were just a scared little girl all alone with the wicked Lannisters.,6,7,31
13001,arya, f,arya,"  The northern lords will read it.  They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa if they knew how she did Cersei's bidding.  What would little Lyanna Mormont say?  She's younger than you were when you wrote this.  Are you going to say, ""But I was just a child""?",6,7,47
13002,arya, f,arya,  Sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things.  I'll go with anger.,6,7,11
13003,arya, f,arya, Are you sure you want to do this?,7,7,8

13084,arya, f,arya, Neither do I.,4,8,3
13085,arya, f,arya,  Probably.,4,8,1
13086,arya, f,arya, I came to kill Cersei. Your queen got there first.,6,8,10
13087,arya, f,arya, Try telling Sansa.,6,8,3
13088,arya, f,arya, Jon. She knows who you are. Who you really are. You'll always be a threat to her. And I know a killer when I see one.,6,8,26
13089,arya, f,arya, Say another word about killing my brother and I'll cut your throat.,6,8,12
13090,arya, f,arya, I can't.,6,8,2
13091,arya, f,arya, (chuckles)  I'm not going back north.,6,8,6
13092,arya, f,arya, What's west of Westeros?,6,8,4
13093,arya, f,arya, No one knows. It's where all the maps stop. That's where I'm going.,6,8,13
13094,arya, f,arya, Right here.,6,8,2
13095,arya, f,arya,  Could l have one? A lemon one or any of them.,9,1,11
13096,arya, f,arya,  How about a nice fat pigeon?,9,1,6
13097,arya, f,arya,  Do you have any stale ones from yesterday? Or any burnt ones?,9,1,12
13098,arya, f,arya,"  Hey, where's everyone going? What's happening?",9,1,6
13099,arya, f,arya,  Who?,9,1,1
13100,arya, f,arya,  Let me go.,9,1,3
13101,arya, f,arya,"  You said right, but you went left.",8,1,7
13102,arya, f,arya,  Only 'cause you lied.,8,1,4
13103,arya, f,arya,"  I was so. I watched, but you...",8,1,7
13104,arya, f,arya,  My father wouldn't send you.,8,1,5
13105,arya, f,arya,  And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.,8,1,12
13106,arya, f,arya,  Come with me. Run.,8,1,4
13107,arya, f,arya,  Not today.,8,1,2

13109,arya, f,arya,  Needle.,8,1,1
13110,arya, f,arya,  What do you want?,8,1,4
13111,arya, f,arya,  Leave me be. My father's a lord. He'll reward you.,8,1,10
13112,arya, f,arya,  Stay away!,8,1,2
13113,arya, f,arya,  l'm not a boy!,10,1,4
13114,arya, f,arya,  Arry.,10,1,1
13115,arya, f,arya,  (pointing Needle at Hot Pie) You want it? l'll give it to you. l already killed one fat boy. l bet you never killed anyone. l bet you're a liar. But l'm not. l'm good at killing fat boys. l like killing fat boys.,10,1,44
13116,arya, f,arya,  lt was a gift.,10,1,4
13117,arya, f,arya,  Which are you?,10,1,3
13118,arya, f,arya,  I'm practicing.,3,1,2
13119,arya, f,arya, The Prince.,3,1,2
13120,arya, f,arya, He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.,3,1,11
13121,arya, f,arya, The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do.,3,1,10
13122,arya, f,arya," You're a liar. And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive.",3,1,13
13123,arya, f,arya, Go away!,3,1,2
13124,arya, f,arya,  Mine.,3,1,1
13125,arya, f,arya, I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady.,3,1,11
13126,arya, f,arya,  It's called Needle.,3,1,3
13127,arya, f,arya, Stick 'em with the pointy end.,3,1,6
13128,arya, f,arya, I was trying to learn. I asked Mycah to practice with me. I asked him. It was my fault.,3,1,19
13129,arya, f,arya," I hate them! I hate all of them. The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa.",3,1,19
13130,arya, f,arya, So was I! He is a liar.,3,1,7
13131,arya, f,arya, But how you can let her marry someone like that?,3,1,10
13132,arya, f,arya, Winter is coming.,3,1,3
13133,arya, f,arya, I don't hate her. Not really.,3,1,6
13134,arya, f,arya, I can keep it?,3,1,4
13135,arya, f,arya,  Who are you?,3,1,3
13136,arya, f,arya,  It's too heavy.,3,1,3
13137,arya, f,arya, What if I drop it?,3,1,5
13138,arya, f,arya, I'm a girl.,3,1,3
13139,arya, f,arya,  A needle.,3,1,2
13140,arya, f,arya," Thank you, Nymeria. Septa Mordane says I have to do it again. ""My things weren't properly folded"", she says. Who cares how they're folded?! They're going to get all messed up anyway.",2,1,32
13141,arya, f,arya," Watch. Nymeria, gloves.",2,1,3
13142,arya, f,arya,"  Shut up. Nymeria, gloves!",2,1,4
13143,arya, f,arya,  A present?,2,1,2
13144,arya, f,arya,  It's so skinny.,2,1,3
13145,arya, f,arya, I can be quick.,2,1,4
13146,arya, f,arya, I think so.,2,1,3
13147,arya, f,arya,  I know which end to use.,2,1,6
13148,arya, f,arya,  Sansa can keep her sewing needles. I've got a needle of my own.,2,1,13
13149,arya, f,arya, What are you doing here? Go away.,2,1,7
13150,arya, f,arya, He's my friend.,2,1,3

13152,arya, f,arya,  Nymeria!,2,1,1

13155,arya, f,arya,  I'm sorry.,2,1,2
13156,arya, f,arya, No.,2,1,1
13157,arya, f,arya,  That's not true! She just... Bit him a little. He was hurting Mycah.,2,1,13
13158,arya, f,arya,  That's not what happened!,2,1,4
13159,arya, f,arya,  Liar!,2,1,1
13160,arya, f,arya, Liar! Liar liar liar!,2,1,4
13161,arya, f,arya,  Liar liar liar!,2,1,3
13162,arya, f,arya, Lady wasn't there! You leave her alone!,2,1,7
13163,arya, f,arya, Move!,1,1,1
13164,arya, f,arya, Where’s the Imp?,1,1,3
13165,arya, f,arya, Arya.,1,1,1
13166,arya, f,arya, That’s Jaime Lannister. The queen’s twin brother.,1,1,7
13167,arya, f,arya, Where’s the Imp?,1,1,3
13168,arya, f,arya, Come on. I'm not gonna hurt you.,5,1,7
13169,arya, f,arya, I'm not a beggar. I live here.,5,1,7
13170,arya, f,arya, I want to see my father.,5,1,6
13171,arya, f,arya," My father is Hand of the King! I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes! Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?",5,1,56
13172,arya, f,arya, They said they were going to kill you.,5,1,8
13173,arya, f,arya," I didn't see them, but I think one was fat.",5,1,10
13174,arya, f,arya, I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage... something about the savage.,5,1,23
13175,arya, f,arya," In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls.",5,1,7
13176,arya, f,arya, Chasing a cat.,5,1,3
13177,arya, f,arya, I'm a girl!,5,1,3
13178,arya, f,arya, How many guards does my father have?,5,1,7
13179,arya, f,arya," You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you?",5,1,8
13180,arya, f,arya, Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours.,4,1,12
13181,arya, f,arya, Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better. Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.,4,1,20
13182,arya, f,arya, He says every swordsman should study cats. They're quiet as shadows and as light as feathers. You have to be quick to catch them.,4,1,24
13183,arya, f,arya, Now that Bran's awake will he come live with us?,4,1,10
13184,arya, f,arya,"He wants to be a knight of the King’s Guard. He can't be one now, can he?",4,1,17
13185,arya, f,arya, Can I be Lord of a holdfast?,4,1,7
13186,arya, f,arya, No. That's not me.,4,1,4
13187,arya, f,arya, Why do they call you Littlefinger?,4,1,6
13188,arya, f,arya,  I don’t want to practice today.,6,1,6
13189,arya, f,arya, They killed Jory. My father is hurt. I don’t care about stupid wooden swords.,6,1,14
13190,arya, f,arya,  Yes -,6,1,2
13191,arya, f,arya, I don’t like dolls and k -,6,1,7
13192,arya, f,arya,  Are you dying because of your leg? Is that why you’re sending us home?,6,1,14
13193,arya, f,arya,  You can’t. I’ve got my lessons with Syrio. I’m finally getting good.,6,1,12
13194,arya, f,arya,  Can’t we take Syrio back with us?,6,1,7
13195,arya, f,arya, Seven hells.,6,1,2
13196,arya, f,arya," The lion’s not his sigil, idiot. He’s a stag, like his father.",6,1,12
13197,arya, f,arya,  Come on! (dragging Sansa),6,1,4
13198,arya, f,arya, You’re good at that. Where did you learn?,8,6,8
13199,arya, f,arya, And good at putting holes in them.,8,6,7
13200,arya, f,arya, What happened to the actress? The one who wanted you dead.,8,6,11
13201,arya, f,arya, Mmm.,8,6,1
13202,arya, f,arya, I can’t.,8,6,2
13203,arya, f,arya, I don’t think I could remember all of the lines.,8,6,10
13204,arya, f,arya, You wouldn’t be safe. Not while she’s looking for me.,8,6,10
13205,arya, f,arya, She doesn’t have a name.,8,6,5
13206,arya, f,arya, Essos is east and Westeros is west. But what’s west of Westeros?,8,6,12
13207,arya, f,arya, Nobody does. That’s where all the maps stop.,8,6,8
13208,arya, f,arya, I’d like to see that.,8,6,5
13209,arya, f,arya, What’s that?,8,6,2
13210,arya, f,arya, I don’t want any.,8,6,4
13211,arya, f,arya, Lady Crane?,8,6,2
13212,arya, f,arya, Lady Crane?,8,6,2
13213,arya, f,arya, You told her to kill me.,8,6,6
13214,arya, f,arya, A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell and I’m going home.,8,6,11
13215,arya, f,arya, My name is Arya Stark. I want you to know that. The last thing you’re ever going to see is a Stark smiling down at you as you die.,10,6,29
13216,arya, f,arya, No one.,3,6,2
13217,arya, f,arya, Arya Stark.,3,6,2
13218,arya, f,arya," Her father was Eddard Stark. Her mother was Catelyn Stark. She had one sister, Sansa, and four brothers.",3,6,18
13219,arya, f,arya, Three brothers.,3,6,2
13220,arya, f,arya," Rob, Bran, Rickon. And a half-brother, Jon.",3,6,7
13221,arya, f,arya, They may be dead for all a girl knows.,3,6,9
13222,arya, f,arya, Also dead.,3,6,2
13223,arya, f,arya, Arya Stark left him to die. He was on her list.,3,6,11
13224,arya, f,arya, He was not on her list anymore. She’d taken him off it.,3,6,12
13225,arya, f,arya, She did and she did not.,3,6,6
13226,arya, f,arya," Yes, she was.",3,6,3
13227,arya, f,arya," Cersei Lannister, Gregor Clegane, Walder Frey.",3,6,6
13228,arya, f,arya, Which name would you like a girl to speak?,3,6,9
13229,arya, f,arya, A girl has no name.,3,6,5
13230,arya, f,arya, No one.,3,6,2
13231,arya, f,arya, No one.,2,6,2
13232,arya, f,arya, No one.,2,6,2
13233,arya, f,arya, A girl has no name.,2,6,5
13234,arya, f,arya, A girl has no name.,2,6,5
13235,arya, f,arya, A girl has no name.,2,6,5
13236,arya, f,arya, Thank you.,1,6,2
13237,arya, f,arya, I can’t see.,1,6,3
13238,arya, f,arya, Who was the first?,5,6,4
13239,arya, f,arya, Where did they go?,5,6,4
13240,arya, f,arya, A girl has no desires.,5,6,5
13241,arya, f,arya, Who?,5,6,1
13242,arya, f,arya, A girl will poison the rum. Lady Crane is the only one who drinks it.,5,6,15
13243,arya, f,arya, If a girl could use one of the faces from the hall…,5,6,12
13244,arya, f,arya, She’s a good actress.,5,6,4
13245,arya, f,arya, Seems like a decent woman.,5,6,5
13246,arya, f,arya, No. Who wants her dead?,5,6,5
13247,arya, f,arya, The younger actress. She’s jealous because Lady Crane is better.,5,6,10
13248,arya, f,arya, A girl has decided.,5,6,4
13249,arya, f,arya, Nothing.,6,6,1
13250,arya, f,arya, Three times.,6,6,2
13251,arya, f,arya, No.,6,6,1
13252,arya, f,arya, You’re very good.,6,6,3
13253,arya, f,arya," So change it. It would all just be farting, belching, and slapping without you.",6,6,14
13254,arya, f,arya, The queen loves her son more than anything. And he was taken from her before she could say good-bye. She wouldn’t just cry. She would be angry. She would want to kill the person who did this to her.,6,6,39
13255,arya, f,arya, Mercy.,6,6,1
13256,arya, f,arya, I have to go. My father’s waiting for me.,6,6,9
13257,arya, f,arya, Careful of that one. She wants you dead.,6,6,8
13258,arya, f,arya, You’re Westerosi.,7,6,2
13259,arya, f,arya, I want to book passage home.,7,6,6
13260,arya, f,arya, Why do you care?,7,6,4
13261,arya, f,arya, I want a cabin. And we’ll leave at dawn.,7,6,9
13262,arya, f,arya, See you at sunrise.,7,6,4
13263,olenna, m,olenna," So their son will be your nephew. After you're wed to Cersei, of course. And you will be the king's stepfather and brother-in-law. When you marry the king, Joffrey's mother will become his sister-in-law and your son will be Loras' nephew?  Grandson?  I'm not sure. But your brother will become your father-in-law. That much is beyond dispute.",8,3,57
13264,olenna, m,olenna," Kiss me, child.",2,3,3
13265,olenna, m,olenna, It's so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens. We're very sorry for your losses.,2,3,20
13266,olenna, m,olenna," Gallant, yes. And charming and very clean. He knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king.",2,3,27
13267,olenna, m,olenna, Loras is young and very good at knocking men off horses with a stick. That does not make him wise. As to your fathead father-,2,3,25
13268,olenna, m,olenna," She might think we have some wits about us. One of us, at any rate. It was treason. I warned them. Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother. How could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair? We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me. But once the cow's been milked, there's no squirting the cream back up her udders. So here we are to see things through. What do you say to that, Sansa? Shall we have some lemon cakes?",2,3,92
13269,olenna, m,olenna," So we've been told. (To the SERVANT) Are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death? Here, Sansa, come sit with me. I'm much less boring than these others.",2,3,36
13270,olenna, m,olenna, Do you know my son? The Lord of Highgarden?,2,3,9
13271,olenna, m,olenna," No great pleasure, believe me. A ponderous oaf. His father was an oaf as well. My husband, the late Lord Luthor. He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking. They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him. And now my son is doing the same, only this time he's riding a lion instead of a horse. Now I want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy, this Joffrey.",2,3,84
13272,olenna, m,olenna," You, you. Who else would know better? We've heard some troubling tales. Is there any truth to them? Has this boy mistreated you?",2,3,23
13273,olenna, m,olenna, Has he ripped out your tongue?,2,3,6
13274,olenna, m,olenna," Yes, all Lannisters are lions. And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose. But how kind is he? How clever? Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?",2,3,30
13275,olenna, m,olenna, Bring me some cheese.,2,3,4
13276,olenna, m,olenna, The cheese will be served when I want it served. And I want it served now.,2,3,16
13277,olenna, m,olenna," Are you frightened, child? No need for that. We're only women here. Tell us the truth. No harm will come to you.",2,3,22
13278,olenna, m,olenna," Yes, he had that reputation. And they named him traitor and took his head.",2,3,14
13279,olenna, m,olenna, Go on.,2,3,2
13280,olenna, m,olenna," Speak freely, child. We would never betray your confidence, I swear it.",2,3,12
13281,olenna, m,olenna, Ah. That's a pity.,2,3,4
13282,olenna, m,olenna," Have no fear. The Lord Oaf of Highgarden is determined that Margaery shall be queen. Even so, we thank you for the truth. Ah, here comes my cheese.",2,3,28
13283,olenna, m,olenna," Gods, boy, that's enough. We're not in a tavern.",5,3,9
13284,olenna, m,olenna, No need to speak. Are there any figs? Fetch some. I always take figs midafternoon. They help move the bowels. To what do I owe this summons?,5,3,27
13285,olenna, m,olenna, I climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters?,5,3,9
13286,olenna, m,olenna, Naturally.,5,3,1
13287,olenna, m,olenna, What good is the word extravagant if it can't be used to describe a royal wedding?,5,3,16
13288,olenna, m,olenna, Good.,5,3,1
13289,olenna, m,olenna, And?,5,3,1
13290,olenna, m,olenna," Oh, I'd nearly forgotten.",5,3,4
13291,olenna, m,olenna," I can't think how it slipped my mind. What is it, 12,000 infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied? 2,000 in support. Provisions so this city might survive the winter. A million bushels of wheat. Half a million bushels each of barley, oats, and rye. 20,000 head of cattle. 50,000 sheep. You don't have to lecture me about wartime expenses. I'm quite familiar with them.",5,3,64
13292,olenna, m,olenna," As is a royal wedding. The people are hungry for more than just food. They crave distractions. And if we don't provide them, they'll create their own. And their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces. A royal wedding is much safer. Wouldn't you say?",5,3,49
13293,olenna, m,olenna, And traditionally paid for by the royal family.,5,3,8
13294,olenna, m,olenna," I was told you were drunk, impertinent, and thoroughly debauched. You can imagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper. Where did you go for them, Volantis?",5,3,29
13295,olenna, m,olenna," Oh, very well. I won't have it said that House Tyrell refuses to play its part. We'll pay for half the expenses and the celebrations will go on as planned. Is that sufficient?",5,3,33
13296,olenna, m,olenna," Very good, then. That's settled. Good day.",5,3,7
13297,olenna, m,olenna,  There appears to be a good deal of room elsewhere on the premises for everyone else.,4,3,16
13298,olenna, m,olenna," No, the rest are there to look adoringly upon the 700 to remind them how superior they must be to have the best seats.",4,3,24
13299,olenna, m,olenna," You were married here, Your Grace?",4,3,6
13300,olenna, m,olenna, Must seem like only yesterday.,4,3,5
13301,olenna, m,olenna," Your husband, was he buried here as well?",4,3,8
13302,olenna, m,olenna, Such a tragedy.,4,3,3
13303,olenna, m,olenna, I should say not. My son's a hunter. It helps him forget he's never been within a mile of a real battle.,4,3,22
13304,olenna, m,olenna, All he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent.,4,3,13
13305,olenna, m,olenna," I told him to stay out of Robert's rebellion. He had no business fighting an actual warrior. We mothers do what we can to keep our sons from the grave. But they do seem to yearn for it. We shower them with good sense, and it slides right off like rain off a wing.",4,3,54
13306,olenna, m,olenna," A ridiculous arrangement, to my mind.",4,3,6
13307,olenna, m,olenna," Another golden rose. How original. I eat from plates stamped with roses. I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses. I have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot, as if that makes it smell any better. Roses are boring, dear. 'Growing strong.' Ha! The dullest words of any house. 'Winter is coming!' Now that's memorable. 'We do not sow.' Strong. Strong. Those are houses you watch out for. Direwolves and krakens, fierce beasts. But a golden rose growing strong--ha, that strikes fear in the heart.",4,3,86
13308,olenna, m,olenna," Look, little loves. A spider in the garden. Run along now. Grow strong.",4,3,13
13309,olenna, m,olenna," The city is made brighter by my presence? Is that your usual line, Lord Varys? Are you here to seduce me?",4,3,21
13310,olenna, m,olenna," Oh, no, please. Seduce away. It's been so long. Though I rather think it's all for naught. What happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit? A question for the philosophers. But you've come mincing all this way for something. So?",4,3,41
13311,olenna, m,olenna," No. Come, I've heard you're such a clever man. I'm curious why you've sought me out.",4,3,16
13312,olenna, m,olenna, Have I? Because I spoke to her once in this garden and one of your little spies came running to tell you? Why shouldn't I take an interest? She's an interesting girl.,4,3,32
13313,olenna, m,olenna," No, not particularly. But she's had an interesting childhood.",4,3,9
13314,olenna, m,olenna," Come, come. You surrender rather easily. Walk with me. I know the walls have ears, but apparently the shrubbery does, too.",4,3,21
13315,olenna, m,olenna, Which is Sansa Stark?,4,3,4
13316,olenna, m,olenna," Yes. Ned Stark had many admirers, and how many stepped forward when the executioner came for his head?",4,3,18
13317,olenna, m,olenna, How?,4,3,1
13318,olenna, m,olenna, That's hardly surprising. She's a beautiful girl with a famous name.,4,3,11
13319,olenna, m,olenna, It almost feels as if you're about to arrive at the point.,4,3,12
13320,olenna, m,olenna, And why have you come to me with this matter?,4,3,10
13321,olenna, m,olenna, (laughs),4,3,1
13322,olenna, m,olenna," And if Littlefinger marries her, he'll have the key in his pocket.",4,3,12
13323,olenna, m,olenna, You must despise him. You're working so hard to undermine him.,4,3,11
13324,olenna, m,olenna," You are a clever man, Lord Varys.",4,3,7
13325,olenna, m,olenna," One doesn't need to be clever for that. It's all rather obvious, isn't it?",4,3,14
13326,olenna, m,olenna, Impossible.,6,3,1
13327,olenna, m,olenna, My grandson is the pride of Highgarden. The most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms. Your daughter--,6,3,17
13328,olenna, m,olenna, Old.,6,3,1
13329,olenna, m,olenna," Old. I'm something of an expert on the subject. Her change will be upon her before long. I'll spare you the details of what will happen then. You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter, but this is another matter entirely.",6,3,43
13330,olenna, m,olenna," Oh, not at all. A sword swallower through and through.",6,3,10
13331,olenna, m,olenna," Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin? Sons of your father's bannermen, squires, stable boys?",6,3,17
13332,olenna, m,olenna, And you never--,6,3,3
13333,olenna, m,olenna, Not once? Not in any way?,6,3,6
13334,olenna, m,olenna," I congratulate you upon your restraint. But it's a natural thing, two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets.",6,3,22
13335,olenna, m,olenna," Lie or not, you must admit many people find it quite convincing. Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation.",6,3,34
13336,olenna, m,olenna," As an authority on myself, I must disagree.",6,3,8
13337,olenna, m,olenna," And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children, we're throwing another prized flower into the dirt. It is a chance we simply cannot take.",6,3,26
13338,olenna, m,olenna, Oh,6,3,1
13339,olenna, m,olenna, You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you?,6,3,11
13340,olenna, m,olenna," More than you were with Renly. Less than you would have been if Joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying. In any case, this would not be an opportune moment to press the issue.",3,4,39
13341,olenna, m,olenna," The world is overflowing with horrible things. But they're all a tray of cakes next to death. They brought me your grandfather's body when he died, you know? Made me look at it.",3,4,33
13342,olenna, m,olenna, They took me to the Great Hall and there he was. The man I'd married and suffered to father my children. A great doughy lump I'd sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings. There he was... lying on a table.,3,4,42
13343,olenna, m,olenna," Nonsense. Your circumstances have improved markedly. You may not have enjoyed watching him die, but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him, I can promise you that.",3,4,33
13344,olenna, m,olenna, Our alliance with the Lannisters remains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us. You did wonderful work on Joffrey. The next one should be easier.,3,4,30
13345,olenna, m,olenna,  It feels proportionate.,2,4,3
13346,olenna, m,olenna, The expected extravagance.,2,4,3
13347,olenna, m,olenna, You ought to try enjoying something before you die. You might find it suits you.,2,4,15
13348,olenna, m,olenna," Not now, Mace. Lord Tywin and I are speaking.",2,4,9
13349,olenna, m,olenna," Anyway, I don't know what you're complaining about. I'm paying my share.",2,4,12
13350,olenna, m,olenna," No, your heartfelt thank-you is it's own reward. I would imagine I'd be hearing it again before long. Wars are rather expensive. ""The Iron Bank will have it's due."" How they love to remind everyone. Almost as much as you Lannisters with your debts.",2,4,44
13351,olenna, m,olenna," We both know you're smarter than that. Come, Tywin, let us celebrate young love.",2,4,14
13352,olenna, m,olenna," You look exquisite, child. The wind has been at you, though. I haven't had the opportunity to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your brother. War is war, but killing a man at a wedding, horrid. What sort of monster would do such a thing? As if men need more reasons to fear marriage.",2,4,57
13353,olenna, m,olenna," Lord Tyrion, you see? Not as bad as all that. Perhaps if your pauper husband were to sell his mule and his last pair of shoes, he might be able to afford to bring you to Highgarden for a visit. Now that peace has come and all is right with the world, it would do you good to see some of it. You must excuse me. It's time I ate some of this food I paid for.",2,4,77
13354,olenna, m,olenna, Help the poor boy.,2,4,4
13355,olenna, m,olenna," Idiots, help your king. -",2,4,5
13356,olenna, m,olenna," No. No. You're a queen, not an ox.",1,4,8
13357,olenna, m,olenna, Your grandfather gave me a necklace just like this one for my 51st nameday.,1,4,14
13358,olenna, m,olenna, Nonsense.,1,4,1
13359,olenna, m,olenna," My little dears. Go and speak to the jewelers of King's Landing. Tell them who you are, tell them who sent you. The one who brings me the best necklace will get to keep the next best.",1,4,37
13360,olenna, m,olenna," The Margaery Tyrell who walks into the sept a fortnight from now will inspire 1,000 songs. Now, how sad it will be if she's wearing rubbish like that.",1,4,28
13361,olenna, m,olenna," You watch that. Even here, even with me.",1,4,8
13362,olenna, m,olenna, My word.,1,4,2
13363,olenna, m,olenna, We know who you are. We've heard all about you. But hearing is one thing. Aren't you just marvelous? Absolutely singular.,1,4,21
13364,olenna, m,olenna, I hear you knocked my grandson into the dirt like the silly little boy he is.,1,4,16
13365,olenna, m,olenna, You dare not refuse.,1,4,4
13366,olenna, m,olenna," The time has come, my dear. There's nothing more tedious than a trial. Except perhaps these gardens. If I have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens, I'll fling myself from the cliffs.",4,4,35
13367,olenna, m,olenna, Have you been to see Tommen yet?,4,4,7
13368,olenna, m,olenna," I wasn't originally meant to marry your grandfather Luthor, you know. He was engaged to my sister, your great-aunt Viola. I was to be given to some Targaryen or other. Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then. But the momentI saw my intended, with his twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair, I knew he wouldn't do. So the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister, I got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber.",4,4,87
13369,olenna, m,olenna,  How absentminded of me.,4,4,4
13370,olenna, m,olenna," The following morning, Luthor never made it down the stairs to propose to my sister 'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk.",4,4,21
13371,olenna, m,olenna," And once he could, the only thing he wanted was what I'd given him the night before. I was good. I was very, very good. You are even better. But you need to act quickly. Cersei may be vicious, but she's not stupid. She'll turn the boy against you as soon as she can. And by the time you're married, it'll be too late. Luckily for you ,the Queen Regent is rather distracted at the moment, mourning her dear departed boy. Accusing her brother of his murder, which he didn't commit.",4,4,91
13372,olenna, m,olenna," He could have done,but he didn't.",4,4,6
13373,olenna, m,olenna," But I do know. You don't think I'd let you marry that beast, do you?",4,4,15
13374,olenna, m,olenna, Shh. Don't you worry yourself about all that. You just do what needs to be done.,4,4,16
13375,olenna, m,olenna," Oh! You can smell the shit from 5 miles away. Well, why are we stopped, go on.",6,5,17
13376,olenna, m,olenna," Rumors and gossip, that’s all they got. It’s theater, nothing more. If they arrested all the pillow biters in King’s Landing there’d be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else.",6,5,32
13377,olenna, m,olenna, Renly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms. Everyone knew. No one cared.,6,5,16
13378,olenna, m,olenna," And Loras is the queen’s brother. No, no, no, no, this is unacceptable.",6,5,13
13379,olenna, m,olenna," Of course she is. She wants to drag our names through the dirt. Put us in our place. Get some rest, dear, you look appalling. Let me deal with Cersei Lannister.",6,5,31
13380,olenna, m,olenna," Your Grace, I have travelled a long way.",6,5,8
13381,olenna, m,olenna," Put the pen down, dear, we all know you aren’t writing anything.",6,5,12
13382,olenna, m,olenna, And the famous tart Queen Cersei.,6,5,6
13383,olenna, m,olenna, I know you’re behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson.,6,5,10
13384,olenna, m,olenna, You’ll get your apology when I get Loras.,6,5,8
13385,olenna, m,olenna," Has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops, gold, and wheat my house supplies?",6,5,14
13386,olenna, m,olenna, Do you expect the alliance to continue after you’ve thrown our future into prison?,6,5,14
13387,olenna, m,olenna, What veil?,6,5,2
13388,olenna, m,olenna, I didn’t trust your father. I didn’t particularly like him. But I respected him. He was no fool. He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them.,6,5,32
13389,olenna, m,olenna, Well I think that’s quite enough of that.,6,5,8
13390,olenna, m,olenna, What are you doing? Let us pass.,6,5,7
13391,olenna, m,olenna," You there! Where would I find the High Septon, or High Sparrow, or whatever bloody fool name he’s got.",7,5,19
13392,olenna, m,olenna, You should have the decency to stand when you talk to a lady.,7,5,13
13393,olenna, m,olenna, Don’t spar with me little fellow.,7,5,6
13394,olenna, m,olenna, Hips.,7,5,1
13395,olenna, m,olenna," A man of the people, is that your game? It’s an old game. dull and unconvincing. A man of the people who does Cersei’s dirty work for her.",7,5,28
13396,olenna, m,olenna," Spare me the homilies, I can smell a fraud from a mile away.",7,5,13
13397,olenna, m,olenna, I’m here for my grandson and granddaughter.,7,5,7
13398,olenna, m,olenna, Don’t you walk away from me.,7,5,6
13399,olenna, m,olenna, What is it you want? Gold? I’ll make you the richest septon who ever lived.,7,5,15
13400,olenna, m,olenna, What then?,7,5,2
13401,olenna, m,olenna, How do they communicate their demands? By raven or horse?,7,5,10
13402,olenna, m,olenna, I’ve read the seven pointed star.,7,5,6
13403,olenna, m,olenna," Half the men, women, and children in this foul city break the sacred laws. You live among murderers, thieves, and rapists. And yet you punish Loras for shagging and Margaery for defending her brother?",7,5,34
13404,olenna, m,olenna," If it’s equality you want then so be it. When House Tyrell stops sending our crops to the capital, everyone here will starve. And I’ll make sure the hungry know who to blame,",7,5,33
13405,olenna, m,olenna, No you’re not.,7,5,3
13406,olenna, m,olenna," Not for your clientele, clearly.",7,5,5
13407,olenna, m,olenna," You’ve always been rather impressed with yourself, haven’t you?",7,5,9
13408,olenna, m,olenna," Don’t pretend to have any concern for my house, my grandchildren, or me. I should have known you’d return to the capital once things started going wrong.",7,5,27
13409,olenna, m,olenna," I promise you, Lord Baelish, that our fates are joined. Together we murdered a king. And if my house should fall, I would have nothing to hide. And if i should meet with some accident here at this broken little flesh market, they’ll never even find what’s left of you. So do you deny a part in all of this?",7,5,60
13410,olenna, m,olenna, And what did she want?,7,5,5
13411,olenna, m,olenna, What kind of gift?,7,5,4
13412,olenna, m,olenna,  It's done?,3,7,2
13413,olenna, m,olenna,  And now the rains weep for our whores.  Did we fight well?,3,7,12
13414,olenna, m,olenna,  It was never our forte.  Golden roses indeed.  Your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending Casterly Rock.,3,7,21
13415,olenna, m,olenna,  So you'll just let them take it?,3,7,7
13416,olenna, m,olenna,"  And you took your army, your real army, and went where they weren't?",3,7,13
13417,olenna, m,olenna,  Yes.  You must be very wise by now.,3,7,8
13418,olenna, m,olenna,"  If he was so clever why didn't he take Highgarden the moment your gold mines ran dry?  I suppose I'll be able to ask him myself soon enough.  No more learning from my mistakes, eh?  How will you do it?  With that sword?",3,7,43
13419,olenna, m,olenna,"  That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it?  Not that he ever used it.  What did he call it?",3,7,17
13420,olenna, m,olenna,"  He really was a cunt, wasn't he?  I did unspeakable things to protect my family, or watched them being done on my orders.  I never lost a night's sleep over them.  They were necessary.  And whatever I imagined necessary for the safety of House Tyrell I did.  But your sister has done things I wasn't capable of imagining.  That was my prize mistake, a failure of imagination.  She's a monster, you do know that?",3,7,74
13421,olenna, m,olenna,  You love her.  You really do love her.  You poor fool.  She'll be the end of you.,3,7,17
13422,olenna, m,olenna,  What better person to discuss it with?  What better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room?  But perhaps you're right.  If she's driven you this far it's gone beyond your control.,3,7,38
13423,olenna, m,olenna,  She's a disease.  I regret my role in spreading it.  You will too.,3,7,13
13424,olenna, m,olenna,  How will it happen?,3,7,4
13425,olenna, m,olenna,  Will there be pain?,3,7,4
13426,olenna, m,olenna,  That's good.,3,7,2
13427,olenna, m,olenna,"  I'd hate to die like your son clawing at my neck, foam and bile spilling from my mouth, eyes blood red, skin purple.  It must have been horrible for you as a Kingsguard, as a father.  It was horrible enough for me.  A shocking scene.  Not at all what I intended.  You see, I'd never seen the posion work before.  Tell Cersei.  I want her to know it was me.",3,7,70
13428,olenna, m,olenna,"  That's very nice to hear.  Of course, I can't remember a queen who was better loved than my grand daughter.  The common people loved her, the nobles loved her.  And what is left of her now?  Ashes.  Commoners, nobles, they're all just children really.  They won't obey you unless they fear you.",2,7,52
13429,olenna, m,olenna,"  So, your master plan is to use our armies?  Forgive me for asking, but why did you bother to bring your own?",2,7,22
13430,olenna, m,olenna,"  Peace.  Do you think that's what we had under your father or his father or his?  Peace never lasts, my dear.  Would you take a bit of advice from an old woman?",2,7,32
13431,olenna, m,olenna,"  He's a clever man, your Hand.  I've known a great many clever men.  I've outlived them all.  Do you know why?  I ignored them.  The lords of Westeros are sheep.  Are you a sheep?  No.  You're a dragon.  Be a dragon.",2,7,41
13432,olenna, m,olenna," The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne, he was assassinated. 100 red scorpions, was it?",10,6,16
13433,olenna, m,olenna," You murder your own prince, but you expect me to trust you?",10,6,12
13434,olenna, m,olenna, What is your name again? Barbaro?,10,6,6
13435,olenna, m,olenna, Obara. You look like an angry little boy. Don’t presume to tell me what I need.,10,6,16
13436,olenna, m,olenna," Do shut up, dear.",10,6,4
13437,olenna, m,olenna, Anything from you?,10,6,3
13438,olenna, m,olenna, No? Good. Let the grown women speak.,10,6,7
13439,olenna, m,olenna, Cersei stole the future from me. She killed my son. She killed my grandson. She killed my granddaughter. Survival is not what I’m after now.,10,6,25
13440,olenna, m,olenna, And what is my heart’s desire?,10,6,6
13441,olenna, m,olenna, He’s beaten us. That’s what’s happening.,6,6,6
13442,olenna, m,olenna, Does it move or talk? I want to speak with you alone.,7,6,12
13443,olenna, m,olenna," Oh, this is madness!",7,6,4
13444,olenna, m,olenna," You’re not in your sanctuary now, my dear. All I have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about...",7,6,26
13445,olenna, m,olenna, ...until I tell them to stop. If I tell them to stop. You could use a good bashing.,7,6,18
13446,olenna, m,olenna, What have they done to you?,7,6,6
13447,olenna, m,olenna, We marched for you.,7,6,4
13448,olenna, m,olenna, And what about your brother? What mercy did they show him?,7,6,11
13449,olenna, m,olenna, Have you lost your mind?,7,6,5
13450,olenna, m,olenna," He is the heir to Highgarden, the future of House Tyrell.",7,6,11
13451,olenna, m,olenna, As a mindless fanatic.,7,6,4
13452,olenna, m,olenna, You will leave for Highgarden today. There is no law that says you must stay here.,7,6,16
13453,olenna, m,olenna, I will never leave you. Never.,7,6,6
13454,olenna, m,olenna," I’ll see you soon, my dear.",7,6,6
13455,olenna, m,olenna, That is hardly your concern.,7,6,5
13456,olenna, m,olenna, Loras rots in a cell because of you. THe High Sparrow rules this city because of you. Our two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity.,7,6,29
13457,olenna, m,olenna, Good.,7,6,1
13458,olenna, m,olenna," I wonder if you’re the worst person I’ve ever met. At a certain age, it’s hard to recall. But the truly vile do stand out through the years. Do you remember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells? I do. I’ll never forget it.",7,6,54
13459,olenna, m,olenna," I’m leaving this wretched city as fast as I can before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells. If you’re half as bright as you think you are, you’ll find your way out of here, too.",7,6,39
13460,olenna, m,olenna," What’ll you do, then? You have no support. Not anymore. Your brother’s gone. The High Sparrow saw to that. The rest of your family have abandoned you. The people despise you. You’re surrounded by enemies, thousands of them. You’re going to kill them all by yourself? You’ve lost, Cersei. It’s the only joy I can find in all this misery.",7,6,60
13461,qyburn, m,qyburn, ( coughing ) Water. Water.,1,3,5
13462,qyburn, m,qyburn, Qyburn.,1,3,1
13463,qyburn, m,qyburn, Lucky?,1,3,1
13464,qyburn, m,qyburn, No. The corruption has spread. I fear it must be cut away. The safest course would be to take the whole arm off.,5,3,23
13465,qyburn, m,qyburn," The Citadel stripped me of it. They found some of my experiments too bold. I can leave your upper arm, make the cut at your elbow.",5,3,26
13466,qyburn, m,qyburn," With any luck, that will suffice. You'll need milk of the poppy.",5,3,12
13467,qyburn, m,qyburn, There will be pain.,5,3,4
13468,qyburn, m,qyburn, Quite a bit of pain.,5,3,5
13469,qyburn, m,qyburn, Here. Let me.,7,3,3
13470,qyburn, m,qyburn, It will take time.,7,3,4
13471,qyburn, m,qyburn," How is the pain, my lord?",7,3,6
13472,qyburn, m,qyburn,"  Well, we've stymied the corruption.",7,3,5
13473,qyburn, m,qyburn, All the good it's done me.,7,3,6
13474,qyburn, m,qyburn," Faint praise, my lord.",7,3,4
13475,qyburn, m,qyburn,"  No, my lord. That's not my weakness.",7,3,7
13476,qyburn, m,qyburn,  Curiosity. The only way to treat disease is to understand disease. And the only way to understand it is to study the afflicted.,7,3,23
13477,qyburn, m,qyburn, On dying men.,7,3,3
13478,qyburn, m,qyburn,  My studies have given me insight that has saved many lives.,7,3,11
13479,qyburn, m,qyburn," How many men have you killed, my lord?",7,3,8
13480,qyburn, m,qyburn, 50? 100?,7,3,2
13481,qyburn, m,qyburn, Countless.,7,3,1
13482,qyburn, m,qyburn, And how many lives have you saved?,7,3,7
13483,qyburn, m,qyburn,  A bird flew off and a bird flew back.  Lord Selwyn Tarth offered 300 gold dragons for his daughter's safe return.,7,3,21
13484,qyburn, m,qyburn, A fair offer. Locke won't take it.,7,3,7
13485,qyburn, m,qyburn,  He's convinced Lord Tarth owns all the sapphire mines in Westeros.,7,3,11
13486,qyburn, m,qyburn, He feels he's being cheated.,7,3,5
13487,qyburn, m,qyburn," These men have been at war a long time. Most of them will be dead by winter. She'll be their entertainment tonight. Beyond tonight, I don't think they care very much.",7,3,31

13489,qyburn, m,qyburn, Yes there is.,10,4,3
13490,qyburn, m,qyburn, Saving him.,10,4,2
13491,qyburn, m,qyburn, That's for the best. No Maester knows how to save him.,10,4,11
13492,qyburn, m,qyburn," Difficult to say, your grace, but if my past work is any guide. We stand a chance.",10,4,17
13493,qyburn, m,qyburn," Thank you, your grace. You should know, the process may change him, somewhat.",10,4,13
13494,qyburn, m,qyburn, Oh no.,10,4,2
13495,qyburn, m,qyburn," A work of art, really. The craftsmanship is excellent.",1,4,9
13496,qyburn, m,qyburn, The symptoms have abated?,1,4,4
13497,qyburn, m,qyburn," Not a maester, Your Grace, but happy to help whenever I can.",1,4,12
13498,qyburn, m,qyburn, The trial will take place. The High Sparrow will be presenting a substantial case against you.,8,5,16
13499,qyburn, m,qyburn," Fornication, treason, incest, the murder of King Robert.",8,5,8
13500,qyburn, m,qyburn," Of course, Your Grace. My concern is that The Faith does not adhere to the same standards of proof as the crown. And I hope you’ll excuse me for saying it, but belief is so often the death of reason.",8,5,40
13501,qyburn, m,qyburn," I’m afraid not. Your Grace, Grand Maester Pycelle has summoned your Uncle Kevan back from Casterly Rock to serve as Hand of the King. He now presides over the small council.",8,5,31
13502,qyburn, m,qyburn, I implored him to visit you but he would not.,8,5,10
13503,qyburn, m,qyburn," Your arrest, and Queen Margaery’s arrest, the king has not taken well. He remains in his chambers, his servants often find his food in the hall. Left untouched.",8,5,28
13504,qyburn, m,qyburn," I tried my grace, he wouldn’t see me. He wouldn’t see anyone.",8,5,12
13505,qyburn, m,qyburn," There is a way, Your Grace. A way out.",8,5,9
13506,qyburn, m,qyburn, Goodbye my queen. The work continues.,8,5,6
13507,qyburn, m,qyburn, Your Grace. It’s good to have you back. Come. We’ll take you inside. I need to have a look at those feet.,10,5,22
13508,qyburn, m,qyburn, May I have the honor of presenting the newest member of the Kingsguard.,10,5,13
13509,qyburn, m,qyburn," If it please Your Grace, he’s taken a holy vow of silence. He has sworn that he will not speak until all his Grace’s enemies are dead, and the evil has been driven from the realm.",10,5,36
13510,qyburn, m,qyburn, It doesn't matter. (Mace sits down).,3,5,6
13511,qyburn, m,qyburn, I heard this all began in Littlefinger's brothel.,3,5,8
13512,qyburn, m,qyburn, So you were administering to the needs of these devout prostitutes?,3,5,11
13513,qyburn, m,qyburn, Your Grace.,3,5,2
13514,qyburn, m,qyburn," At once, Your Grace. (Walks to his desk).",3,5,8
13515,qyburn, m,qyburn, Very well.,3,5,2
13516,qyburn, m,qyburn," More than I've expected. Still a way to go, but…",3,5,10
13517,qyburn, m,qyburn," Shh. Easy, friend.",3,5,3
13518,qyburn, m,qyburn," Pardon me, Your Grace. I would take it, if you don't mind. It could prove useful for my work.",2,5,19
13519,qyburn, m,qyburn, Over there will be fine.,2,5,5
13520,qyburn, m,qyburn,  The Long Farewell.,3,7,3
13521,qyburn, m,qyburn,"  Difficult to say.  Hours, days, it depends on the subject's constitution.",3,7,11
13522,qyburn, m,qyburn,"  Oh yes, Your Grace, quite certain.",3,7,6
13523,qyburn, m,qyburn,"  We are currently at work on a solution, My Lord.",2,7,10
13524,qyburn, m,qyburn,"  Have you ever been down here, Your Grace?",2,7,8
13525,qyburn, m,qyburn,  Curious that King Robert did not have them destroyed.,2,7,9
13526,qyburn, m,qyburn,"  Balerion the Dread.  The beast that Aegon rode across the sea.  Its flames forged the Iron Throne and brought the Seven Kingdoms to heel.  Powerful, but not invincible.",2,7,28
13527,qyburn, m,qyburn,"  Apparently one of Daenarys' dragons was wounded by spears in the fighting pits of Meereen.  If they can be wounded, they can be killed.",2,7,24
13528,qyburn, m,qyburn,"  The finest artilleters and blacksmiths in King's Landing have been laboring day and night, Your Grace.  If you'd kindly pull that lever.",2,7,22
13529,qyburn, m,qyburn,  My Lord.,5,7,2
13530,qyburn, m,qyburn,  Ser Jaime.,5,7,2
13531,qyburn, m,qyburn," I'm afraid I don't know, Your Grace. No one has seen her.",7,7,12
13532,qyburn, m,qyburn, They're on their way to the dragon pit now.,7,7,9
13533,qyburn, m,qyburn," Yes, Your Grace.",7,7,3
13534,qyburn, m,qyburn," Your Grace, I'm afraid I bring terrible news. The dead have broken through the Wall.",1,8,15
13535,qyburn, m,qyburn, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.,1,8,5
13536,qyburn, m,qyburn," Apologies for the interruption, but the queen did urge me to hurry.",1,8,12
13537,qyburn, m,qyburn, Poor girl. The pox will take her within the year.,1,8,10
13538,qyburn, m,qyburn, The queen's brothers made promises to you and broke them. Her Grace wants to rectify their mistake.,1,8,17
13539,qyburn, m,qyburn," That was Ser Jaime's doing, not hers. When Queen Cersei wants something, she pays in advance and in gold. Several chests of it, in fact. Waiting for you in a wagon just outside.",1,8,33
13540,qyburn, m,qyburn, She has other plans for the Targaryen girl.,1,8,8
13541,qyburn, m,qyburn, Our queen's brothers are unlikely to survive their Northern adventures. But in the event that they do-,1,8,17
13542,qyburn, m,qyburn, She has a keen sense of poetic justice.,1,8,8
13543,qyburn, m,qyburn," When the Citadel expelled me, I thought I would die poor and alone, but in exchange for my service, Queen Cersei made me her Hand. What would she do for the man who rids her of her treasonous brothers?",1,8,39
13544,qyburn, m,qyburn, Your people have heard the Usurper is coming. They are grateful for your protection within the walls of the Red Keep.,4,8,21
13545,qyburn, m,qyburn, My lord.,4,8,2
13546,qyburn, m,qyburn," Queen Cersei demands Daenerys's unconditional surrender. If she refuses, Missandei of Naath will die here and now.",4,8,17
13547,qyburn, m,qyburn," Or so I flatter myself, my lord.",4,8,7
13548,qyburn, m,qyburn, Yes.,4,8,1
13549,qyburn, m,qyburn," No, it is not a pleasant sound.",4,8,7
13550,qyburn, m,qyburn," My lord, I am only a mouthpiece for our queen.",4,8,10
13551,qyburn, m,qyburn, Cersei is Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. You are her subject.,4,8,11
13552,qyburn, m,qyburn," We understand nothing of the sort. Your queen's last dragon is vulnerable. Your armies are battle-weary and depleted, while ours have been reinforced with the Golden Compan--",4,8,27
13553,qyburn, m,qyburn," Your Grace, several members of the Faith Militant have been permitted entry to the Red Keep.",8,6,16
13554,qyburn, m,qyburn," They demand to see you, Your Grace.",8,6,7
13555,qyburn, m,qyburn," He is, Your Grace. He’s currently in his chambers at prayer.",8,6,11
13556,qyburn, m,qyburn, Your Grace...that old rumor you told me about. My little birds investigated.,8,6,12
13557,qyburn, m,qyburn, More. Much more.,8,6,3
13558,qyburn, m,qyburn," Elsewhere, I’m afraid.",10,6,3
13559,qyburn, m,qyburn," Please, Grand Maester. I bear you no ill will. Please forgive me if you can.",10,6,15
13560,qyburn, m,qyburn," This pains me, my lord. Whatever your faults, you do not deserve to die alone in such a cold, dark place. But sometimes before we can usher in the new, the old must be put to rest.",10,6,37
13561,qyburn, m,qyburn," Your Grace, there’s no need--",10,6,5
13562,qyburn, m,qyburn," What are your thoughts concerning the king’s funeral? As the Sept of Baelor is no longer an option, perhaps a ceremony in the throne room?",10,6,25
13563,qyburn, m,qyburn," I now proclaim Cersei of the House Lannister First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms.",10,6,25
13564,qyburn, m,qyburn, Long may she reign.,10,6,4
13565,qyburn, m,qyburn," Your eye looks much better, Arthur. How’s your mother’s jaw?",3,6,10
13566,qyburn, m,qyburn, And your father?,3,6,3
13567,qyburn, m,qyburn, And no one will. That worked out rather nicely.,3,6,9
13568,qyburn, m,qyburn, I don’t think so. Do you miss him?,3,6,8
13569,qyburn, m,qyburn, It’s funny you should mention that. Guess what I happened to find today. Candied plums from Dorne.,3,6,17
13570,qyburn, m,qyburn," Now remember, if any of your friends like sweets or need help, they can always come to me. All I need in return are whispers.",3,6,25
13571,qyburn, m,qyburn, No need to be afraid. This is Ser Gregor. He’s friends with all my friends.,3,6,15
13572,qyburn, m,qyburn, Run along now.,3,6,3
13573,qyburn, m,qyburn," Your little birds now, your Grace.",3,6,6
13574,qyburn, m,qyburn," Oh, a number of things.",3,6,5
13575,sansa, f,sansa," You look very handsome, my lord.",8,3,6
13576,sansa, f,sansa," I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord.",8,3,9
13577,sansa, f,sansa," I doubt that very much, my lord.",8,3,7
13578,sansa, f,sansa,  When I have to.,8,3,4
13579,sansa, f,sansa, What are you doing?,8,3,4
13580,sansa, f,sansa," Will you pardon me, my lord?",8,3,6
13581,sansa, f,sansa," Thank you, Your Grace.",8,3,4
13582,sansa, f,sansa," Yes, Your Grace.",8,3,3
13583,sansa, f,sansa," Is that wise, my lord?",8,3,5
13584,sansa, f,sansa," Is that wise, Tyrion?",8,3,4
13585,sansa, f,sansa, What?,8,3,1
13586,sansa, f,sansa, 14,8,3,1
13587,sansa, f,sansa, But your father--,8,3,3
13588,sansa, f,sansa, What if I never want you to?,8,3,7
13589,sansa, f,sansa, What are you doing?,10,3,4
13590,sansa, f,sansa, A list of people you mean to kill?,10,3,8
13591,sansa, f,sansa, You should learn to ignore them.,10,3,6
13592,sansa, f,sansa, You're a Lannister. I am the disgraced daughter of the traitor Ned Stark.,10,3,13
13593,sansa, f,sansa, (laughs),10,3,1
13594,sansa, f,sansa, So how should we punish them?,10,3,6
13595,sansa, f,sansa, Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.,10,3,7
13596,sansa, f,sansa, I hear that you're a pervert.,10,3,6
13597,sansa, f,sansa," (chuckles) We could sheep shift Lord Desmond's bed. You cut a little hole in his mattress and you stuff sheep dung inside. Then you sew up the hole and make his bed again. His room will stink, but he won't know where it's coming from.",10,3,45
13598,sansa, f,sansa, My sister used to do that when she was angry with me. And she was always angry with me.,10,3,19
13599,sansa, f,sansa, That's the vulgar word for dung.,10,3,6
13600,sansa, f,sansa," Well, you asked me.",10,3,4
13601,sansa, f,sansa, He didn't. He didn't want anything. He just takes an interest because he loved my mother.,2,3,16
13602,sansa, f,sansa, Littlefinger's not in love with me.,2,3,6
13603,sansa, f,sansa, He's too old.,2,3,3
13604,sansa, f,sansa, No.,2,3,1
13605,sansa, f,sansa, Why? What will you do? I will make him stop.,2,3,10
13606,sansa, f,sansa, Send him in.,2,3,3
13607,sansa, f,sansa, Ser Loras.,2,3,2
13608,sansa, f,sansa," You are too kind, Ser Loras. You probably don't remember the first time we met. At the Hand's tourney, you gave me your favor. A rose, a red rose.",2,3,29
13609,sansa, f,sansa," Thank you, Ser Loras.",2,3,4
13610,sansa, f,sansa," And I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery. He was very gallant.",2,3,17
13611,sansa, f,sansa, Lemon cake's my favorite.,2,3,4
13612,sansa, f,sansa, I haven't had the pleasure.,2,3,5
13613,sansa, f,sansa," I--, I--",2,3,2
13614,sansa, f,sansa,"  Joff-King Joffrey, he-His Grace is very fair and handsome and as brave as a lion",2,3,15
13615,sansa, f,sansa, My father always told the truth.,2,3,6
13616,sansa, f,sansa, Joffrey. Joffrey did that. He promised he would be merciful and he cut my father's head off. And he said that was mercy. Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it.,2,3,37
13617,sansa, f,sansa, I-I can't. I never meant-my father was a traitor. My brother as well. I have traitor's blood. Please don't make me say anymore.,2,3,23
13618,sansa, f,sansa, He's a monster.,2,3,3
13619,sansa, f,sansa," Please, don't stop the wedding.",2,3,5
13620,sansa, f,sansa, Dorne. It's going to Dorne.,1,3,5
13621,sansa, f,sansa, It's carrying silk and it's supposed to bring back wine in exchange. But it's not coming back. The captain's tired of risking his life so King's Landing lords and ladies can get drunk on better wine than they deserve. He's going to stay in Dorne. Wait out the winter where it's beautiful and warm.,1,3,54
13622,sansa, f,sansa, Don't ruin the game.,1,3,4
13623,sansa, f,sansa, (pointing to another ship) What about that one there?,1,3,9
13624,sansa, f,sansa, Why?,1,3,1
13625,sansa, f,sansa, That's not how the game works. You're not supposed to just blurt out the right answer. You've got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why.,1,3,30
13626,sansa, f,sansa, Because the truth is always either terrible or boring.,1,3,9
13627,sansa, f,sansa, Lord Baelish.,1,3,2
13628,sansa, f,sansa, Arya's alive? You said you'd take me home.,1,3,8
13629,sansa, f,sansa, I won't tell anyone.,1,3,4
13630,sansa, f,sansa," Because I'm a terrible liar. You said so yourself. Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do. Tell me when.",1,3,20
13631,sansa, f,sansa, He's such a splendid fighter. Do you have any idea when we might,5,3,13
13632,sansa, f,sansa, Joffrey won't let me leave. He's got too many reasons to keep me here.,5,3,14
13633,sansa, f,sansa, What is?,5,3,2
13634,sansa, f,sansa, Is it?,5,3,2
13635,sansa, f,sansa, Many ladies wear it this way.,5,3,6
13636,sansa, f,sansa, You still want me to come with you?,5,3,8
13637,sansa, f,sansa," Of course. More than anything. But maybe it would be better to wait. I've been thinking how dangerous it would be. Not just for me, but for you. You've been so kind. I'd feel terrible if anything happened to you. I can't tell you how touched I am by your concern for my welfare.",5,3,54
13638,sansa, f,sansa," I do, Lord Baelish.",5,3,4
13639,sansa, f,sansa, Petyr.,5,3,1
13640,sansa, f,sansa, You haven't.,4,3,2
13641,sansa, f,sansa, I can't tell you.,4,3,4
13642,sansa, f,sansa," I'm sorry, I just can't.",4,3,5
13643,sansa, f,sansa, Pig-face? That's ridiculous.,4,3,3
13644,sansa, f,sansa, (laughs),4,3,1
13645,sansa, f,sansa, Porridge plague?,4,3,2
13646,sansa, f,sansa, But that's awful.,4,3,3
13647,sansa, f,sansa, So what happened to Alanna?,4,3,5
13648,sansa, f,sansa, I'm sure she's jealous of you now. You'll be married here in the capital and she'll have to come watch and pretend to be happy that you're queen.,4,3,28
13649,sansa, f,sansa, That would make me very happy.,4,3,6
13650,sansa, f,sansa, (nods),4,3,1
13651,sansa, f,sansa, That's a wonderful pin.,6,3,4
13652,sansa, f,sansa,  I'm very happy about,6,3,4
13653,sansa, f,sansa, I feel like I'm in a dream.,6,3,7
13654,sansa, f,sansa, No. I had never left Winterfell before I came to King's Landing. But it sounds wonderful. I can't wait to see it. And to leave this place.,6,3,27
13655,sansa, f,sansa, Do you think people will like it?,6,3,7
13656,sansa, f,sansa," You're right. It's not my wedding. Anyway, from what I can tell, the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in King's Landing. They'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding. Loras likes green and gold brocade.",6,3,44
13657,sansa, f,sansa, Will they let me invite my family?,6,3,7
13658,sansa, f,sansa, But do you think they will?,6,3,6
13659,sansa, f,sansa," Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion. I was just trying on a gown for King Joffrey's wedding.",6,3,15
13660,sansa, f,sansa, Of course.,6,3,2
13661,sansa, f,sansa," Shae. Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion. She's not from here. But I trust her, even though she tells me not to.",6,3,21
13662,sansa, f,sansa," It's all right, really.",6,3,4
13663,sansa, f,sansa, How do I make the best of my circumstances? I have to marry him.,7,3,14
13664,sansa, f,sansa, No.,7,3,1
13665,sansa, f,sansa,  He's tried.,7,3,2
13666,sansa, f,sansa, He's a Lannister.,7,3,3
13667,sansa, f,sansa,  I'm sorry. Here I am complaining to you.,7,3,8
13668,sansa, f,sansa, I'm not afraid of the pain. Not after what Joffrey's done to me.,7,3,13
13669,sansa, f,sansa, And that's a good thing?,7,3,5
13670,sansa, f,sansa, How do you know all this? Did your mother teach you?,7,3,11
13671,sansa, f,sansa, He can stay.,8,4,3
13672,sansa, f,sansa," *to Petyr* I'm sorry, Lord Baelish. I have to tell the truth. *to the council* I'll tell you everything.",8,4,19
13673,sansa, f,sansa," My name is not Alayne. It's Sansa Stark, eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark. Lord Royce, we met when you came to Winterfell. You were escorting your son Ser Waymar to the Wall.",8,4,33
13674,sansa, f,sansa," Lord Baelish has told many lies. All to protect me. Since my father was executed, I have been a hostage in King's Landing. A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment. They beat me, they humiliated me, they married me to the Imp. I had no friends in King's Landing...except one. He saved me. Smuggled me away when he had the chance. He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa. The Lannisters have friends everywhere. Even the Vale. He made me swear not to tell anyone my true name.",8,4,100
13675,sansa, f,sansa," You knew her well, my lords, my lady. You knew she was a troubled woman. She always loved Lord Baelish. She told me herself. From the moment he arrived at the gates of Riverrun, a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack. She confessed to me she never loved Lord Arryn. She did as her father commanded, as so many of us have. When the gods finally allowed her to be with Lord Baelish, she was so happy. For a time. My aunt was a jealous lady. She was terrified that Lord Baelish didn't love her anymore. That he would abandon her for a younger woman. And then...one day she saw him kiss me.",8,4,118
13676,sansa, f,sansa," It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce, nothing more. Lord Baelish is my uncle now, in truth, by marriage. He's always been so kind to me. I was so happy to be here, to be free. All because of him. But my aunt turned on me. She cursed me. Called me a whore. Promised to throw me through the Moon Door. When Lord Baelish tried to calm her, she struck him. She said she didn't want to live anymore. She stood on the edge of that Moon Door. He tried to reason with her. Promised her she was the only one he had ever loved, but she stepped through those doors and she was...*begins sobbing*",8,4,117
13677,sansa, f,sansa, Yes?,8,4,1
13678,sansa, f,sansa, They would have thrown you through the Moon Door if they found you guilty.,8,4,14
13679,sansa, f,sansa," If they'd have executed you, what would they have done with me?",8,4,12
13680,sansa, f,sansa, Neither do I.,8,4,3
13681,sansa, f,sansa, I know what you want.,8,4,5
13682,sansa, f,sansa, Shall we go?,8,4,3
13683,sansa, f,sansa, Where are we going?,3,4,4
13684,sansa, f,sansa, Lord Baelish?,3,4,2
13685,sansa, f,sansa, (shakes her head.),3,4,3
13686,sansa, f,sansa, I didn't murder anyone.,3,4,4
13687,sansa, f,sansa, Why did you kill him?,3,4,5
13688,sansa, f,sansa, He saved me.,3,4,3
13689,sansa, f,sansa, He was helping me because I saved his life.,3,4,9
13690,sansa, f,sansa, We're all liars here.,3,4,4
13691,sansa, f,sansa, We have a new queen.,2,4,5
13692,sansa, f,sansa,  Can we leave now?,2,4,4
13693,sansa, f,sansa," No, thank you.",1,4,3
13694,sansa, f,sansa," No, thank you.",1,4,3
13695,sansa, f,sansa, I don't need to eat.,1,4,5
13696,sansa, f,sansa, How can you help me?,1,4,5
13697,sansa, f,sansa, I lie awake all night staring at the canopy thinking about how they died.,1,4,14
13698,sansa, f,sansa, Do you know what they did to my brother? How they sewed his direwolf's head onto his body? And my mother. They say they cut her throat to the bone and threw her body in the river.,1,4,37
13699,sansa, f,sansa," Will you pardon me, my lord? I'd like to visit the godswood.",1,4,12
13700,sansa, f,sansa, I don't pray anymore. It's the only place I can go where people don't talk to me.,1,4,17
13701,sansa, f,sansa,  You're drunk.,1,4,2
13702,sansa, f,sansa, Ser Dontos. The king's nameday celebration. I'm sorry. I should have remembered.,1,4,12
13703,sansa, f,sansa, Anyone would have done the same.,1,4,6

13711,sansa, f,sansa, I would never say a thing.,5,4,6
13712,sansa, f,sansa," They did, and my father's.",5,4,5
13713,sansa, f,sansa, Make him fly?,5,4,3
13714,sansa, f,sansa, They did. They made us both. Lord Tyrion didn't want to.,5,4,11
13715,sansa, f,sansa," It's a pleasure to meet you, Robin.",5,4,7
13716,sansa, f,sansa, Thank you.,5,4,2
13717,sansa, f,sansa,  Really?,5,4,1
13718,sansa, f,sansa, My mother fat? She never let me have my pudding until I'd finished all my proper food.,5,4,17
13719,sansa, f,sansa, They're delicious. Where did you get the lemons? You can't grow them up here.,5,4,14
13720,sansa, f,sansa, Yes. I'm very lucky.,5,4,4
13721,sansa, f,sansa," Oh, I know he does. I'm so grateful.",5,4,8
13722,sansa, f,sansa," Well, I'm half Tully. He loved your family so much.",5,4,10
13723,sansa, f,sansa, No.,5,4,1
13724,sansa, f,sansa," He loves you, Aunt Lysa. He's married to you.",5,4,9

13730,sansa, f,sansa, You're hurting me.,5,4,3
13731,sansa, f,sansa," I'm a virgin, I swear it. He loves you, Aunt Lysa. All he says is that I'm stupid.

13732,sansa, f,sansa, Where are you taking me?,4,4,5

13734,sansa, f,sansa, I know it was you.,4,4,5
13735,sansa, f,sansa," Well, there was Ser Dontos. You used him to get me out of King's Landing, but you would never trust him to kill the king.",4,4,25
13736,sansa, f,sansa, Because you're too smart to trust a drunk.,4,4,8
13737,sansa, f,sansa, No.,4,4,1
13738,sansa, f,sansa, I just do.,4,4,3
13739,sansa, f,sansa," The poison. I don't understand. The Lannisters gave you wealth, power. Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal.",4,4,18
13740,sansa, f,sansa," I don't believe you. If they catch you, they'll put your head on a spike just like my father's. You'd risk that just to confuse them?",4,4,26
13741,sansa, f,sansa, And what do you want?,4,4,5
13742,sansa, f,sansa, Who could trust you?,4,4,4

13746,sansa, f,sansa," Yes, you certainly are.",7,4,4
13747,sansa, f,sansa, Probably never. My family doesn't live there anymore and someone burned it down.,7,4,13
13748,sansa, f,sansa," No, I'm afraid not. It's not high up in the mountains. It's down on the ground.",7,4,16
13749,sansa, f,sansa, We don't.,7,4,2
13750,sansa, f,sansa, I never did anything with them at all. Girls didn't take part in that where I came from.,7,4,18
13751,sansa, f,sansa, I like the sound of that.,7,4,6
13752,sansa, f,sansa, All right.,7,4,2
13753,sansa, f,sansa, Careful. You've ruined it. Now I'm going to have to rebuild the whole thing.,7,4,14
13754,sansa, f,sansa, You did.,7,4,2
13755,sansa, f,sansa, Knocking things down isn't fixing them. It's ruining them.,7,4,9
13756,sansa, f,sansa, You're being stupid.,7,4,3
13757,sansa, f,sansa," Robin, I'm sorry, I--",7,4,4
13758,sansa, f,sansa, I hit him.,7,4,3
13759,sansa, f,sansa, I shouldn't have done that.,7,4,5
13760,sansa, f,sansa, If he tells Aunt Lysa...,7,4,5
13761,sansa, f,sansa, I was trying to remember what everything looked like. I'll never see it again.,7,4,14
13762,sansa, f,sansa, Why did you really kill Joffrey? Tell me why.,7,4,9
13763,sansa, f,sansa, Lord Baelish...,7,4,2

13777,sansa, f,sansa," Do you know where they went, Bran and Rickon?",8,5,9
13778,sansa, f,sansa," Theon, you have to tell me, do you have any idea where Bran and Rickon--",8,5,15
13779,sansa, f,sansa," I know what Ramsay is. I know what he’ll do to me. (looks to Theon) If I’m going to die, let it happen while there’s some of me left.",10,5,29
13780,sansa, f,sansa, That's Moat Cailin.,3,5,3
13781,sansa, f,sansa," On our way down to King's Landing, with my father and Arya and… where are you taking me?",3,5,18
13782,sansa, f,sansa," The Boltons have Winterfell. (He nods). The marriage proposal, it wasn't for you?",3,5,13

13791,sansa, f,sansa, Thank you.,3,5,2

13795,sansa, f,sansa, I thought you still mourn the death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.,2,5,12
13796,sansa, f,sansa, I'll have some.,2,5,3
13797,sansa, f,sansa, I don't see what all the fuss is about. Why do men love it so much?,2,5,16
13798,sansa, f,sansa, Does it give you courage?,2,5,5
13799,sansa, f,sansa, No.,2,5,1
13800,sansa, f,sansa, I saw you at Joffrey's wedding bowing to the king.,2,5,10

13935,sansa, f,sansa, (gasps),7,2,1
13936,sansa, f,sansa, It was his duty. He never liked it.,7,2,8
13937,sansa, f,sansa, Why are you always so hateful?,7,2,6

13948,sansa, f,sansa,  How much do we have?,3,7,5
13949,sansa, f,sansa,  What does that mean?,3,7,4
13950,sansa, f,sansa,  What's the longest winter in the past 100 years?,3,7,9
13951,sansa, f,sansa,"  You're telling me we don't have enough food, especially not if the armies of the north come back to defend Winterfell.",3,7,21
13952,sansa, f,sansa,"  We must prepare for that eventuality.  Every direction the threat comes from, this is the best place to be.  We need to start building up our grain stores with regular shipments from every keep in the north.  If we don't use it by winter's end we'll give it back to them, but if the entire north has to flee to Winterfell there won't be enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them.",3,7,73
13953,sansa, f,sansa,"  Maester Wolkan, you'll see to it?",3,7,6
13954,sansa, f,sansa,  Are they covering those breastplates in leather?,3,7,7

13959,sansa, f,sansa,  I wish Jon was here.,3,7,5
13960,sansa, f,sansa,  Your father's last living true born son.  You're Lord of Winterfell.,3,7,11

13962,sansa, f,sansa,"  Try, please, for me.",3,7,4
13963,sansa, f,sansa,  How do you know all of this?,3,7,7
13964,sansa, f,sansa,  I thought you were the three-eyed raven.,3,7,7

13969,sansa, f,sansa,"  Tyrion is not like the other Lannisters.  He was always kind to me, but it's too great a risk.  ""The Seven Kingdoms will bleed as long as Cersei sits on the Iron Throne.  Join us.  Together we can end her tyranny.""",2,7,41
13970,sansa, f,sansa,  You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?,2,7,7
13971,sansa, f,sansa,  Have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather?  The Mad King invited him to King's Landing and roasted him alive.,2,7,20

13973,sansa, f,sansa,  Then send an emissary.  Don't go yourself.,2,7,7
13974,sansa, f,sansa,  You're abandoning your people.  Your abandoning your home.,2,7,8
13975,sansa, f,sansa,  Whose?,2,7,1
13976,sansa, f,sansa," The castles committed no crimes. And we need every fortress we have for the war to come. We should give the Last Hearth and Karhold to new families, loyal families who supported us against Ramsay.",1,7,35
13977,sansa, f,sansa, And then they broke faith.,1,7,5
13978,sansa, f,sansa, So there's no punishment for treason and no reward for loyalty?,1,7,11
13979,sansa, f,sansa, They died fighting for Ramsay. Give the castles to the families of the men who died fighting for you.,1,7,19
13980,sansa, f,sansa, Will you start wearing a crown?,1,7,6
13981,sansa, f,sansa, So I can't question your decisions anymore?,1,7,7
13982,sansa, f,sansa, Joffrey never let anyone question his authority. You think he was a good king?,1,7,14
13983,sansa, f,sansa, You're as far from Joffrey as anyone I've ever met.,1,7,10
13984,sansa, f,sansa," You're good at this, you know.",1,7,6
13985,sansa, f,sansa, At ruling.,1,7,2

13987,sansa, f,sansa, Why are you laughing?,1,7,4
13988,sansa, f,sansa, He never said that to me.,1,7,6
13989,sansa, f,sansa," Because he was trying to protect us. He never wanted us to see how dirty the world really is, but Father couldn't protect me and neither can you. Stop trying.",1,7,30
13990,sansa, f,sansa, I'm not trying to undermine you.,1,7,6
13991,sansa, f,sansa," You have to be smarter than Father. You need to be smarter than Robb. I loved them, I miss them, but they made stupid mistakes, and they both lost their heads for it.",1,7,33
13992,sansa, f,sansa, Would that be so terrible?,1,7,5
13993,sansa, f,sansa, What does she want?,1,7,4

13996,sansa, f,sansa," You're the military man, but I know her. If you're her enemy, she'll never stop until she's destroyed you. Everyone who's ever crossed her, she's found a way to murder.",1,7,30
13997,sansa, f,sansa, I learned a great deal from her.,1,7,7
13998,sansa, f,sansa," What do you want, Lord Baelish?",1,7,6
13999,sansa, f,sansa," I am safe. I'm at home, surrounded by friends. I have Brienne to protect me from anyone who would harm me.",1,7,21
14000,sansa, f,sansa," At the moment, peace and quiet.",1,7,6
14001,sansa, f,sansa," No need to seize the last word, Lord Baelish. I'll assume it was something clever.",1,7,15
14002,sansa, f,sansa," We need his men. Without the Vale, Ramsay Bolton would still hold this castle. Littlefinger saved us.",1,7,17
14003,sansa, f,sansa, I know exactly what he wants.,1,7,6
14004,sansa, f,sansa,"  You're very kind, my lords, but Jon is our king.  He is doing what he thinks is best.",5,7,18
14005,sansa, f,sansa,  I warned Jon this would happen.  He can't leave the north and expect it to just sit and wait for him like Ghost.,5,7,23
14006,sansa, f,sansa,"  Well, he's not making it easy.  The northern lords are proud.",5,7,11
14007,sansa, f,sansa,  And?,5,7,1
14008,sansa, f,sansa,  Don't do that.,5,7,3
14009,sansa, f,sansa,  Say what you mean.,5,7,4

14013,sansa, f,sansa,"  Winterfell didn't just fall into our hands.  We took it back, and the Mormonts and the Hornwoods and the Wildlings and the Vale, all of us working together.  Now, I'm sure cutting off heads is very satisfying, but that's not the way you get people to work together.",5,7,48
14014,sansa, f,sansa,  How can you even think such a horrible thing?,5,7,9
14015,sansa, f,sansa,  I have work to do.,5,7,5
14016,sansa, f,sansa,  You don't have to.  I know where she is.,4,7,9
14017,sansa, f,sansa,  Yes.,4,7,1
14018,sansa, f,sansa,  You shouldn't have run from the guards.,4,7,7

14020,sansa, f,sansa,  Everyone who knew his face is dead.,4,7,7

14022,sansa, f,sansa,  Your list?,4,7,2
14023,sansa, f,sansa,  How did you get back to Winterfell?,4,7,7
14024,sansa, f,sansa,  Yes.  It's not a very pleasant one.,4,7,7
14025,sansa, f,sansa,"  No, they're not.",4,7,3
14026,sansa, f,sansa,"  Arya, Bran's home too.",4,7,4
14027,sansa, f,sansa,  Bran has visions.,4,7,3
14028,sansa, f,sansa,  Why would you go back there?,4,7,6
14029,sansa, f,sansa,  Who else is on your list?,4,7,6
14030,sansa, f,sansa,  He's declared for House Stark.,4,7,5
14031,sansa, f,sansa,  Why would he give you a dagger?,4,7,7
14032,sansa, f,sansa,  Why?,4,7,1
14033,sansa, f,sansa,  The cutthroat after your fall?,4,7,5
14034,sansa, f,sansa,  He's not a generous man.  He wouldn't give you anything unless he thought he was getting something back.,4,7,18
14035,sansa, f,sansa,  What do you mean it doesn't matter?,4,7,7
14036,sansa, f,sansa,  If they haven't contributed the right amount of grain to the stores then I'm afraid they'll have to make due with --,4,7,22
14037,sansa, f,sansa,  I remember.,6,7,2
14038,sansa, f,sansa,  What?,6,7,1
14039,sansa, f,sansa,  You don't have to read it.  I remember.,6,7,8
14040,sansa, f,sansa,  They forced me to do it.,6,7,6
14041,sansa, f,sansa,  You don't know what it was like.  I was a child.,6,7,11
14042,sansa, f,sansa,  They told me it was the only way to save father.,6,7,11
14043,sansa, f,sansa,  You were there?,6,7,3
14044,sansa, f,sansa,  And what did you do?  Did you come running to the rescue?  Did you fight off the Lannisters and save father?,6,7,21
14045,sansa, f,sansa,  But you didn't.  Just like me.,6,7,6
14046,sansa, f,sansa,"  You should be on your knees thanking me.  We're standing in Winterfell again because of me.  You didn't win it back.  Jon didn't win it back.  He lost the Battle of the Bastards.  The Knight's of the Vale won the battle and they rode north for me while you were off where, traveling the world?",6,7,55
14047,sansa, f,sansa,"  Training.  Well, while you were training I suffered things you can never imagine.",6,7,13
14048,sansa, f,sansa,  You never would have survived what I survived.,6,7,8
14049,sansa, f,sansa,  What are you doing to do with that letter.,6,7,9
14050,sansa, f,sansa,  Who did you show it to?  Where did you find it?,6,7,11
14051,sansa, f,sansa,  Arya --,6,7,2

14053,sansa, f,sansa,  You're angry.  Sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things.,6,7,9
14054,sansa, f,sansa," No, this is the way he is, the way he's always been. He never asked for my opinion. Why would he start now?",7,7,23
14055,sansa, f,sansa," This is his writing, his signature. He pledged to fight for Daenerys Targaryen. He's bent the knee.",7,7,17
14056,sansa, f,sansa, What does that have to do with anything?,7,7,8
14057,sansa, f,sansa, You think he wants to marry her?,7,7,7
14058,sansa, f,sansa," Even if I wanted to, Arya would never go along. She always loved Jon far more than she ever loved me, and she'd kill anyone who betrayed her family.",7,7,29
14059,sansa, f,sansa, Do you know what she is now? Do you know what the Faceless Men are?,7,7,15
14060,sansa, f,sansa, They're killers. And Arya was one of them. What do you think she's after?,7,7,14
14061,sansa, f,sansa, She could want me dead because she thinks I wronged my family.,7,7,12
14062,sansa, f,sansa, To kill me for marrying our enemies and betraying my family.,7,7,11
14063,sansa, f,sansa, To provide proof of my betrayals. To provide justification after she murders me.,7,7,13
14064,sansa, f,sansa, Lady,7,7,1
14065,sansa, f,sansa, Have my sister,7,7,3
14066,sansa, f,sansa, It's not what I want. It's what honor demands.,7,7,9
14067,sansa, f,sansa, That I defend my family from those who would harm us. That I defend the North from those who would betray us.,7,7,22
14068,sansa, f,sansa, You stand accused of murder. You stand accused of treason. How do you answer these charges Lord Baelish?,7,7,18
14069,sansa, f,sansa," Which charges confuse you? Let's start with the simplest one you murdered our aunt, Lysa Arryn. You pushed her through the Moon Door and watched her fall. Do you deny it?",7,7,31
14070,sansa, f,sansa," You did it to take power in the Vale. Earlier, you conspired to murder Jon.",7,7,15
14071,sansa, f,sansa, You had Aunt Lysa send a letter to our parents telling them it was the Lannisters who murdered Jon.,7,7,19
14072,sansa, f,sansa, You conspired with Cersei Lannister and Joffrey Baratheon to betray our father.,7,7,12
14073,sansa, f,sansa, Protected me? By selling me to the Boltons?,7,7,8
14074,sansa, f,sansa," Sometimes when I'm trying to understand a person's motives, I play a little game. I assume the worst. What's the worst reason you have for turning me against my sisterThat's what you do, isn't it? That's what you've always done turn family against family, turn sister against sister. That's what you did to our mother.",7,7,55
14075,sansa, f,sansa," I'm a slow learner, it's true. But I learn.",7,7,9
14076,sansa, f,sansa, (Nods.),7,7,1
14077,sansa, f,sansa," And yet, you betrayed her.",7,7,5
14078,sansa, f,sansa," And yet, you betrayed me.",7,7,5
14079,sansa, f,sansa," When you brought me back to Winterfell, you told me there's no justice in the world, not unless we make it. Thank you for all your many lessons, Lord Baelish. I will never forget them.",7,7,35
14080,sansa, f,sansa," It's just strange. In his own horrible way, I believe he loved me.",7,7,13
14081,sansa, f,sansa, You did it.,7,7,3
14082,sansa, f,sansa, Does that bother you?,7,7,4
14083,sansa, f,sansa, You would have. You're the strongest person I know.,7,7,9
14084,sansa, f,sansa," Well, don't get used to it. You're still very strange and annoying.",7,7,12
14085,sansa, f,sansa, Father,7,7,1
14086,sansa, f,sansa," Me, too.",7,7,2
14087,sansa, f,sansa," You're right. We can't trust him. He attacked my father in the streets. He tried to destroy my house and my family, the same as he did yours.",2,8,28
14088,sansa, f,sansa, You vouch for him?,2,8,4
14089,sansa, f,sansa, You would fight beside him?,2,8,5
14090,sansa, f,sansa," I trust you with my life. If you trust him with yours, we should let him stay.",2,8,17
14091,sansa, f,sansa, Keep them open for as long as you can. There are still people coming in from the countryside.,2,8,18
14092,sansa, f,sansa," Brienne has been loyal to me, always. I trust her more than anyone.",2,8,13
14093,sansa, f,sansa, Tyrion is a good man. He was never anything but decent towards me.,2,8,13
14094,sansa, f,sansa, You never should have either.,2,8,5
14095,sansa, f,sansa, Families are complicated.,2,8,3
14096,sansa, f,sansa, A sad thing to have in common.,2,8,7
14097,sansa, f,sansa," He loves you, you know that.",2,8,6
14098,sansa, f,sansa, Men do stupid things for women. They're easily manipulated.,2,8,9
14099,sansa, f,sansa, I should have thanked you the moment you arrived. That was a mistake.,2,8,13
14100,sansa, f,sansa, Who was the first?,2,8,4
14101,sansa, f,sansa," And what happens afterwards? We defeat the dead, we destroy Cersei. What happens then?",2,8,14
14102,sansa, f,sansa," What about the North? It was taken from us, and we took it back. And we said we'd never bow to anyone else again. What about the North?",2,8,28
14103,sansa, f,sansa, You want us to use you as bait?,2,8,8
14104,sansa, f,sansa, Lurking somewhere.,1,8,2
14105,sansa, f,sansa," Winterfell is yours, Your Grace.",1,8,5
14106,sansa, f,sansa," As soon as we heard about the Wall, I called all our banners to retreat to Winterfell. Lord Umber when can we expect your people to arrive?",1,8,27
14107,sansa, f,sansa, You'll have as many as we can spare. Hurry back to Last Hearth and bring your people here.,1,8,18
14108,sansa, f,sansa," May I ask, how are we meant to feed the greatest army the world has ever seen? While I ensured our stores would last through winter, I didn't account for Dothraki, Unsullied and two full-grown dragons. What do dragons eat, anyway?",1,8,41
14109,sansa, f,sansa," So does Hand of the Queen. Depending on the queen, I suppose.",1,8,12
14110,sansa, f,sansa, It had its moments.,1,8,4
14111,sansa, f,sansa, Apologies for leaving like that.,1,8,5
14112,sansa, f,sansa, We both survived.,1,8,3
14113,sansa, f,sansa, Cersei told you her army was coming north to fight for you?,1,8,12
14114,sansa, f,sansa, And you believed her?,1,8,4
14115,sansa, f,sansa, I used to think you were the cleverest man alive.,1,8,10
14116,sansa, f,sansa, Come in.,1,8,2
14117,sansa, f,sansa," Lord Glover wishes us good fortune, but he's staying in Deepwood Motte with his men.",1,8,15

14123,sansa, f,sansa," No, she's much prettier.",1,8,4
14124,sansa, f,sansa, Did you bend the knee to save the North or because you love her?,1,8,14

14126,sansa, f,sansa," She could have made you happy, for a little while.",4,8,10
14127,sansa, f,sansa, And what's that?,4,8,3
14128,sansa, f,sansa, That was a long time ago. I've seen much worse than you since then.,4,8,14
14129,sansa, f,sansa, And he got what he deserved. I gave it to him.,4,8,11

14134,sansa, f,sansa, It's not just our people. It's yours. You want to throw them into a war they're not ready to fight?,4,8,20
14135,sansa, f,sansa, Arya's the one that killed the Night King.,4,8,8
14136,sansa, f,sansa, And we will never forget them. That doesn't mean that I want to kneel to someone who--,4,8,17
14137,sansa, f,sansa, You respect it?,4,8,3
14138,sansa, f,sansa, You are. You're just as much Ned Stark's child as any of us.,4,8,13
14139,sansa, f,sansa, How can I promise to keep a secret if I don't even know what it is?,4,8,16
14140,sansa, f,sansa, I swear it.,4,8,3
14141,sansa, f,sansa, Why her?,4,8,2
14142,sansa, f,sansa, That doesn't mean she'll be a good queen.,4,8,8

14368,sansa, f,sansa," I did what I had to do to survive, my lady. But I am a Stark. I will always be a Stark.",7,6,22
14369,sansa, f,sansa, I would remind you that House Glover is pledged to House Stark. Sworn to answer when called upon.,7,6,18
14370,sansa, f,sansa, And that’s a good thing?,7,6,5
14371,sansa, f,sansa, 62 Mormonts.,7,6,2
14372,sansa, f,sansa, So he’s your most trusted advisor now? Because he secured 62 men from a ten year old?,7,6,17
14373,sansa, f,sansa," Stannis who lost the Blackwater, who murdered his own brother, who doesn’t have a head?",7,6,15
14374,sansa, f,sansa, It’s not enough. We need more men.,7,6,7
14375,bronn, m,bronn," Come on, I'm here later. Come on.",3,3,7
14376,bronn, m,bronn," Tonight, then. Looks like dull reading.",3,3,6
14377,bronn, m,bronn, It's an opinion I share with some of the finest men I know.,3,3,13
14378,bronn, m,bronn, Unless Lord Twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers to hide what he's really up to.,3,3,16
14379,bronn, m,bronn," She's not bad with second-timers, either.",3,3,6
14380,bronn, m,bronn," Pace yourself, lad.",3,3,3
14381,bronn, m,bronn, Let me guess. He's not a magician.,3,3,7
14382,bronn, m,bronn,  He's stealing it?,3,3,3
14383,bronn, m,bronn, What's wrong with that?,3,3,4
14384,bronn, m,bronn," Seeing as it's his grandson's ass on the throne, I imagine he'll forgive that debt.",3,3,15
14385,bronn, m,bronn, I've never borrowed money before. I'm not clear on the rules.,3,3,11
14386,bronn, m,bronn, And what if I don't?,3,3,5
14387,bronn, m,bronn, But what if I don't?,3,3,5
14388,bronn, m,bronn, The lad's practically skipping.,3,3,4
14389,bronn, m,bronn, He's a squire. You don't pay him.,3,3,7
14390,bronn, m,bronn, Maybe they're trying to curry some favor with the new Master of Coin.,3,3,13
14391,bronn, m,bronn, What did you tell them?,3,3,5
14392,bronn, m,bronn, Of course they seemed to like it. They're paid to seem to like it.,3,3,14
14393,bronn, m,bronn," What are you saying? These ladies enjoyed him so much, they gave him the time for free?",3,3,17
14394,bronn, m,bronn, What if you took off that bit there?,1,3,8
14395,bronn, m,bronn," Trouble is, I've never had much imagination.",1,3,7
14396,bronn, m,bronn, I didn't hear that.,1,3,4
14397,bronn, m,bronn, Back away. Keep backing away till you're outside this establishment. Then back away some more.,1,3,15
14398,bronn, m,bronn," I will murder you, boy.",1,3,5
14399,bronn, m,bronn," Oh, look at these two shining warriors. Ser Taryn Mant and... Ser Whosit of Whocares.",1,3,15
14400,bronn, m,bronn, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.,1,3,5
14401,bronn, m,bronn, Pod.,1,3,1
14402,bronn, m,bronn," That's exactly who I am. And you're a grub in fancy armor who's better at beating little girls than fighting men. Now, I have an appointment with Lord Tyrion.",1,3,29
14403,bronn, m,bronn," As much as I appreciate a walk in the sunshine, your lordship, I am wondering why you sent for me.",1,3,20
14404,bronn, m,bronn, I've been doing that for a while now.,1,3,8
14405,bronn, m,bronn, I grow poor protecting you.,1,3,5
14406,bronn, m,bronn, Briefly.,1,3,1
14407,bronn, m,bronn," And now my pockets are empty. You've given me a taste for the finer things. And if you want me to carry on protecting you, you'll need to pay more.",1,3,30
14408,bronn, m,bronn, We are. But I'm a sellsword. I sell my sword. I don't loan it out to friends as a favor.,1,3,20
14409,bronn, m,bronn, Double.,1,3,1
14410,bronn, m,bronn, I'm a knight now. Knights are worth double.,1,3,8
14411,bronn, m,bronn, Which means you can afford it.,1,3,6
14412,bronn, m,bronn, She's a foot taller than you.,7,3,6
14413,bronn, m,bronn, What's the youngest you've ever had?,7,3,6
14414,bronn, m,bronn, How much older?,7,3,3
14415,bronn, m,bronn," You're a lord, she's a lady. And a beauty at that. I don't see the problem.",7,3,16
14416,bronn, m,bronn, Shae is a whore. Are you gonna marry her? Eh? How did marrying a whore work out for you the first time?,7,3,22
14417,bronn, m,bronn," You want Shae, keep her. Wed one and bed the other. All you have to do is get a son in the Stark girl. He'll be Lord of Winterfell one day. You can rule the North in his name. You'll have two women and a whole kingdom of your own.",7,3,50
14418,bronn, m,bronn," You waste time trying to get people to love you, you'll end up the most popular dead man in town. (chuckles) You want to fuck that Stark girl. You just don't want to admit it.",7,3,35
14419,bronn, m,bronn, You pay me to kill people who bother you. Evil notions come free.,7,3,13
14420,bronn, m,bronn, He tells me you shit gold just like your father.,2,4,10
14421,bronn, m,bronn," There's this knight, Leygood, got thunderbolts on his shield.",2,4,9
14422,bronn, m,bronn," Right here is where I fuck his wife. She's a screamer, that one. If they don't hear her, they won't hear us.",2,4,22
14423,bronn, m,bronn," I've never seen Valyrian steel before. She's a beauty. The problem is, if you fight with an edged blade, I'll have to.",2,4,22
14424,bronn, m,bronn," And if I fight with an edged blade, I'll have no one left to pay me.",2,4,16
14425,bronn, m,bronn, Best time to attack a man.,2,4,6
14426,bronn, m,bronn, Mind yourself. JAIME;  If I still had my right hand...,2,4,10
14427,bronn, m,bronn,  Plan on growing it back?,2,4,5
14428,bronn, m,bronn, All taken care of.,2,4,4
14429,bronn, m,bronn," Aye, she's on it.",2,4,4
14430,bronn, m,bronn," No one knows she's there but you, me, and Varys.",2,4,10
14431,bronn, m,bronn," Because if someone follows me without an invitation, I'm the last person they ever follow.",2,4,15
14432,bronn, m,bronn," She's gone. I know you don't want to believe it, but she is. Now, go drink till it feels like you did the right thing.",2,4,25
14433,bronn, m,bronn, How many Dornishmen does it take to fuck a goat?,1,4,10
14434,bronn, m,bronn," Seems to me the smart place to meet travelers is in a tavern. That way, one party is late, the other party can drink some ale inside.",1,4,27
14435,bronn, m,bronn," If he's so damned important, how come they sent you to meet him?",1,4,13
14436,bronn, m,bronn," And just in case the Martells of Dorne are looking to spill some Lannister blood, it may as well be yours, eh?",1,4,22
14437,bronn, m,bronn, Oh.,1,4,1
14438,bronn, m,bronn, Yellow balls?,1,4,2
14439,bronn, m,bronn, I need a sigil.,1,4,4
14440,bronn, m,bronn, Some accomplished diplomacy that was. Now where?,1,4,7
14441,bronn, m,bronn, How do you plan on finding a single Dornishman in a city this big?,1,4,14
14442,bronn, m,bronn," I'd probably go to sleep, but I'm getting old.",1,4,9
14443,bronn, m,bronn," It started that way, aye. Now I'm a knight.",1,4,9
14444,bronn, m,bronn," Killed the right people, I suppose.",1,4,6
14445,bronn, m,bronn, That was me knocking your ass to the dirt with your own hand.,4,4,13
14446,bronn, m,bronn, You learned to fight like a good little boy. I'll bet that thrust through the MadKing's back was pretty as a picture. You want to fight pretty or you want to win?,4,4,32
14447,bronn, m,bronn, All the time. He got used to it.,4,4,8
14448,bronn, m,bronn," No. Oh, he hated the little twat, sure. But who didn't? And poison's not his style. Or murder, for that matter. You want to know for sure, why don't you ask him?",4,4,32
14449,bronn, m,bronn," You haven't been to see him yet, eh?",4,4,8
14450,bronn, m,bronn, Your brother ever tell you how I came into his service?,4,4,11
14451,bronn, m,bronn, Aye. But only when Lady Arryn demanded the trial take place that day. You were his first choice. He named you for his champion because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him. You gonna fight for him now?,4,4,44
14452,bronn, m,bronn, Compliments of Lord Tyrion. His axe from the Blackwater.,4,4,9
14453,bronn, m,bronn," What are you waiting for, a kiss? Ready the lady's horse.",4,4,11
14454,bronn, m,bronn, My lord.,7,4,2
14455,bronn, m,bronn,  Do you like 'em? Eh? Gloves are doeskin. Softer than a virgin's thighs.,7,4,13
14456,bronn, m,bronn,  I've been a bit busy.,7,4,5
14457,bronn, m,bronn, My lonesome bachelor days are over. I'm to wed Lollys Stokeworth.,7,4,11
14458,bronn, m,bronn, I wouldn't say I had a single sort of girl.,7,4,10
14459,bronn, m,bronn," If I wanted wits, I'd marry you.",7,4,7
14460,bronn, m,bronn," Falyse. Aye, I did know about the older sister.",7,4,9
14461,bronn, m,bronn, Falyse is 40 and barren.,7,4,5
14462,bronn, m,bronn, She does. Unless she happens to perish before her father. Then Lollys gets the castle.,7,4,15
14463,bronn, m,bronn, What? Ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time.,7,4,14
14464,bronn, m,bronn," You once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, you'd double their price.",7,4,16
14465,bronn, m,bronn," One of each will do. But if you want me to kill the Mountain for you, it'd better be a damn big castle.",7,4,23
14466,bronn, m,bronn, I have gold. What can I buy with gratitude?,7,4,9
14467,bronn, m,bronn," Your sister's a Lannister, too.",7,4,5
14468,bronn, m,bronn," If and may and could. It's bloody cold up north. Lollys is soft and warm. And close. If I gave you the choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain, you'd have your britches down and your cock out before I could blink.",7,4,43
14469,bronn, m,bronn," I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me. He's freakish big and freakish strong. And quicker than you'd expect for a man of that size. Maybe I could take him, dance around until he's so tired of hacking at me, he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow. But one misstep... ...and I'm dead. Why should I risk it?",7,4,63
14470,bronn, m,bronn," Aye, I'm your friend. And when have you ever risked your life for me?",7,4,14
14471,bronn, m,bronn," I like you, pampered little shit that you are. I just like myself more.",7,4,14
14472,bronn, m,bronn, I'm sorry it has to be this way.,7,4,8
14473,bronn, m,bronn, We had some good days together.,7,4,6
14474,bronn, m,bronn, What will you do?,7,4,4
14475,bronn, m,bronn, I hope to hear them sing it one day.,7,4,9
14476,bronn, m,bronn, Am I going to be happy at the end of this walk?,9,5,12
14477,bronn, m,bronn, The most beautiful woman in the world.,9,5,7
14478,bronn, m,bronn, Only the one.,9,5,3
14479,bronn, m,bronn, Prince. Sorry about the other day.,9,5,6
14480,bronn, m,bronn, I’m glad to hear it. The pie looks good.,9,5,9
14481,bronn, m,bronn, Maybe I’ll come visit you sometime.,10,5,6
14482,bronn, m,bronn, Don’t wait too long. I’ve a noble woman to marry back home.,10,5,12
14483,bronn, m,bronn, Don't who?,2,5,2
14484,bronn, m,bronn," They certainly do, my dear. They certainly do.",2,5,8
14485,bronn, m,bronn," It's a fine place, isn't it? A fine place. I never thought I'd end up settling down in a place like this.",2,5,22
14486,bronn, m,bronn, Pardon?,2,5,1
14487,bronn, m,bronn, Oh.,2,5,1
14488,bronn, m,bronn, You know what I think? I think you're a good person. And your sister is a mean person.,2,5,18
14489,bronn, m,bronn," I've been all over the world. And if there's one thing I've learned, it's that meanness comes around. People like your sister, they always get what's coming to them eventually. One way or another.",2,5,34
14490,bronn, m,bronn, Jaime fucking Lannister.,2,5,3
14491,bronn, m,bronn, Ser Jaime.,2,5,2
14492,bronn, m,bronn, I was very sorry to hear about your father.,2,5,9
14493,bronn, m,bronn," This is my betrothed, Lollys.",2,5,5
14494,bronn, m,bronn," Run along, love.",2,5,3
14495,bronn, m,bronn, Just get on with it.,2,5,5
14496,bronn, m,bronn, What you're here for. There's no way this little visit could possibly mean anything good for me.,2,5,17
14497,bronn, m,bronn, Lollys will be marrying Ser Wyllis Bracken.,2,5,7
14498,bronn, m,bronn," We made a deal, your sister and I.",2,5,8
14499,bronn, m,bronn, How is this good for me?,2,5,6
14500,bronn, m,bronn, Return from where?,2,5,3
14501,bronn, m,bronn, Why are we on a merchant ship? Why no Lannister sails?,4,5,11
14502,bronn, m,bronn, You ever been to Dorne?,4,5,5
14503,bronn, m,bronn, I have. The Dornish are crazy. All they want to do is fight and fuck. Fuck and fight.,4,5,18
14504,bronn, m,bronn," (Gets up, walking to his knife). There's nothing like a good fight to get you in the mood for fucking. (Pulls out his knife from the sandbag). And there's nothing like a fuck-mad Dornish girl to clear your head for the next fight. It's how the two work together. And we're gonna do a lot of fighting, I am sure. Well, I am. But I don't imagine we'll get to stick around for the rest. Not after we've kidnapped their princess.",4,5,81
14505,bronn, m,bronn, (Incredulously) Your niece?,4,5,3
14506,bronn, m,bronn, I've been doing this sort of thing a long time. I'm good at it. (Sits down).,4,5,16
14507,bronn, m,bronn," I know. Why are you here? Why not send 40 of me, or an army? Unlike most folks, you actually got one.",4,5,22
14508,bronn, m,bronn, That still doesn't explain why you're doing it.,4,5,8
14509,bronn, m,bronn," (Gets up starts walking). If I'm putting something of a lit together, a one-handed man, (Grabs some rope and walks back), who happens to be one of the most recognizable faces in Westeros, is not -",4,5,36
14510,bronn, m,bronn," (Sheaths his sword). You set your brother free, didn't you? I bet your sister didn't like that.",4,5,17
14511,bronn, m,bronn," Well, if you ever see the little fucker, (Lays down), give him my regards.",4,5,14
14512,bronn, m,bronn, Breakfast.,4,5,1
14513,bronn, m,bronn, That would have been a shit way to die.,4,5,9
14514,bronn, m,bronn, Aye. But your lot like to give the singers a good ending.,4,5,12
14515,bronn, m,bronn," No? Two knights, off to rescue a princess. Sounds like a good song to me.",4,5,15
14516,bronn, m,bronn," In my own keep, drinking my own wine, watching my sons grovel for my fortune.",4,5,15
14517,bronn, m,bronn, I've had an exciting life. I want my death to be boring. How do you want to go?,4,5,18
14518,bronn, m,bronn, She want the same thing?,4,5,5
14519,bronn, m,bronn," The captain to that ship… What was he, Braavosi?",4,5,9
14520,bronn, m,bronn, And he's headed to Oldtown?,4,5,5
14521,bronn, m,bronn, What's to stop him from docking down the coast and telling the locals that Jaime Lannister's in Dorne?,4,5,18
14522,bronn, m,bronn, I'm not sure you understand how much people hate your family in this part of the world.,4,5,17
14523,bronn, m,bronn, And I bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it. But you won't be around if he breaks them.,4,5,21
14524,bronn, m,bronn, How many you count?,4,5,4
14525,bronn, m,bronn, How many you think you can take?,4,5,7
14526,bronn, m,bronn," Fucked in the arse. (Both get up). Hiya! (The riders approach them). Morning, lads. Glad we found you.",4,5,18
14527,bronn, m,bronn, Cooper. (Points to Jaime). This is Darnell.,4,5,7
14528,bronn, m,bronn, Accent gave me away? Flea Bottom. Whelped and whipped.,4,5,9
14529,bronn, m,bronn," Our ship capsized in the night. We managed to swim ashore. It was a near thing, really.",4,5,17
14530,bronn, m,bronn, Dolphins maybe.,4,5,2
14531,bronn, m,bronn," Boys, there's no need for this. Just, point us in the right direction. We'll find our way home.",4,5,18
14532,bronn, m,bronn, That one should be slow enough.,4,5,6
14533,bronn, m,bronn, Nice move! (Jaime turns to him).,4,5,6
14534,bronn, m,bronn, You had a wonderful teacher.,4,5,5
14535,bronn, m,bronn, Always wanted a Dornish stallion. Beasts can run a day and night without tiring. We'll ride to the Water Gardens with a nice breeze in our face.,4,5,27
14536,bronn, m,bronn, Birds have to eat too.,4,5,5
14537,bronn, m,bronn, Do you know how long it will take us to dig all those holes?,4,5,14
14538,bronn, m,bronn, The Dornishman’s wife was as fair as the sun and her kisses were warmer than spring. The Dornishman’s blade it was made of black steel and its kiss was a terrible thing. The Dornishman’s wife would sing as she bathed in a voice that was sweet as a peach...,6,5,49
14539,bronn, m,bronn, I’m coming to the best part.,6,5,6
14540,bronn, m,bronn, This song really is all about the ending.,6,5,8
14541,bronn, m,bronn," Once we got the princess, then what?",6,5,7
14542,bronn, m,bronn, That explains the golden hand.,6,5,5
14543,bronn, m,bronn," Well, she’s made herself at home.",6,5,6
14544,bronn, m,bronn," Why don’t you let them have some time alone, son?",6,5,10
14545,bronn, m,bronn, Let’s not do something stupid.,6,5,5
14546,bronn, m,bronn, That was something stupid.,6,5,4
14547,bronn, m,bronn, Oh for fuck’s sake.,6,5,4
14548,bronn, m,bronn, You fight pretty good for a little girl.,6,5,8
14549,bronn, m,bronn," Brothers oh brothers, my days here are done, the Dornishman’s taken my life. Bur what does it matter, for all men must die, and I’ve tasted the Dornishman’s wife! Yes I’ve tasted the Dornishman’s wife!",7,5,35
14550,bronn, m,bronn, It’s against my code to hurt a woman.,7,5,8
14551,bronn, m,bronn, I wouldn’t say you beat me.,7,5,6
14552,bronn, m,bronn, Wonderful. Wouldn’t feel right to leave Dorne without a new scar.,7,5,11
14553,bronn, m,bronn, No great hurry. Dornish women are the most beautiful women in the world.,7,5,13
14554,bronn, m,bronn, I said Dornish women. I didn’t say you.,7,5,8
14555,bronn, m,bronn, I’ve seen quite a few women in all the Seven Kingdoms.,7,5,11
14556,bronn, m,bronn," Well now, in King’s Landing there was an absolutely gorgeous...",7,5,10
14557,bronn, m,bronn, Was I?,7,5,2
14558,bronn, m,bronn, Was there? My memory’s not what it was earlier.,7,5,9
14559,bronn, m,bronn, You seem concerned with it. You must really like me.,7,5,10
14560,bronn, m,bronn, My head… You don’t even wanna know what’s going on in…,7,5,11
14561,bronn, m,bronn, It’s nothing. It’s the dry air.,7,5,6
14562,bronn, m,bronn, You.,7,5,1
14563,bronn, m,bronn, To the boys!,9,2,3
14564,bronn, m,bronn, Drunk Lannisters.,9,2,2
14565,bronn, m,bronn, Thank you very much.,9,2,4
14566,bronn, m,bronn," Well, now let's see. First time, I was five. My mam smacked me with an iron poker.",9,2,17
14567,bronn, m,bronn, It wasn't me she was aiming at. She was trying for my little brother. Now he was a real pest.,9,2,20
14568,bronn, m,bronn," Second time, I was nine. Got in a scrap with a few older boys. They won. Third time",9,2,18
14569,bronn, m,bronn," Eh, you don't want to know about the third time.",9,2,10
14570,bronn, m,bronn, Don't feel sorry for him. He'll be halfway up your arse before the night's through.,9,2,15
14571,bronn, m,bronn," Welcome, friends. This round's on me.",9,2,6
14572,bronn, m,bronn, (whispering) I don't think he likes me.,9,2,7
14573,bronn, m,bronn, I know it.,9,2,3
14574,bronn, m,bronn, It's warm in here. We've got beautiful women and good brown ale. Plenty for everyone. And all you want is to put one of us in the cold ground with no women to keep us company.,9,2,36
14575,bronn, m,bronn, And quicker. Eh?,9,2,3
14576,bronn, m,bronn, Aye I expect he will someday.,9,2,6
14577,bronn, m,bronn, One more drink before the war? Shall we?,9,2,8
14578,bronn, m,bronn, The ships are in the bay.,9,2,6
14579,bronn, m,bronn," I know what ""in"" means. Do you know how to use that?",9,2,12
14580,bronn, m,bronn, I saw you kill a man with a shield. You'll be unstoppable with an ax.,9,2,15
14581,bronn, m,bronn, Don't get killed.,9,2,3
14582,bronn, m,bronn," Oh, are we friends now?",9,2,5
14583,bronn, m,bronn," Enhances it, really.",9,2,3
14584,bronn, m,bronn, Been spending time with fancy folks.,9,2,6
14585,bronn, m,bronn, I like to keep me hands clean.,8,2,7
14586,bronn, m,bronn, I don't want to wear a gold cloak.,8,2,8
14587,bronn, m,bronn," A cloak slows you down in a fight. Makes it hard to move quietly. And the gold catches the light, so you're nice and easy to spot at night.",8,2,29
14588,bronn, m,bronn, We had a deal and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it.,8,2,13
14589,bronn, m,bronn,  What?,8,2,1
14590,bronn, m,bronn, (scoffs) You don't want me cleaning me nails. You don't want me looking your way. Why am I here?,8,2,19
14591,bronn, m,bronn, And one of these explains how to beat him?,8,2,9
14592,bronn, m,bronn, Chevalteesh. I'd swap all your books for a few good archers.,8,2,11
14593,bronn, m,bronn, Me and the lads rounded up all the known thieves.,8,2,10
14594,bronn, m,bronn, No. It's just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now.,8,2,12
14595,bronn, m,bronn," Aye, we talked about it. Have you ever been in a city under siege? Maybe this part's not in your books. See, it's not the fighting that kills most people. It's the starving. Food's worth more than gold. Noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes. Things get bad enough, the poor start eating each other.",8,2,58
14596,bronn, m,bronn," The thieves, they love a siege. Soon as the gates are sealed, they steal all the food. By the time it's all over, they're the richest men in town.",8,2,29
14597,bronn, m,bronn, (nods),8,2,1
14598,bronn, m,bronn, We could throw books at his men.,8,2,7
14599,bronn, m,bronn," We don't have that many men, either.",8,2,7
14600,bronn, m,bronn," Oh, aye. And he has company. Filthy old stoat. Almost hate to interrupt.",3,2,13
14601,bronn, m,bronn," No, I don't.",3,2,3
14602,bronn, m,bronn," The lads will escort you. The streets aren't safe at night, my lord.",2,2,13
14603,bronn, m,bronn, Boys?,2,2,1
14604,bronn, m,bronn, Without question? No. I'd ask how much.,2,2,7
14605,bronn, m,bronn, Can't imagine why.,1,2,3
14606,bronn, m,bronn, It will be my pleasure.,5,2,5
14607,bronn, m,bronn, There's that mind of yours you keep going on about.,5,2,10
14608,bronn, m,bronn, Good thing. I'd be out of a job. What about your father?,5,2,12
14609,bronn, m,bronn, Not after what he did to your birthday present.,5,2,9
14610,bronn, m,bronn, He's talking about you.,5,2,4
14611,bronn, m,bronn, People think you're pulling the king's strings. They blame you for the city's ills.,5,2,14
14612,bronn, m,bronn, You don't need to convince me.,5,2,6
14613,bronn, m,bronn, (scoffs),5,2,1
14614,bronn, m,bronn, If I could tell you how many crazy old men I've seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig shit. No offense meant.,5,2,29
14615,bronn, m,bronn, To do what?,5,2,3
14616,bronn, m,bronn," If you could get real soldiers to man the catapults, then maybe you'd hit your target one time in ten, but all the real soldiers are in the Riverlands with your father.",5,2,32
14617,bronn, m,bronn," I don't know if you've ever seen a battle, old man, but things can get a bit messy. 'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis, he's flinging them right back at us. Men die, men shit themselves, men run, which means pots falling, which means fire inside the walls, which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down.",5,2,64
14618,bronn, m,bronn," Well, he's not living anymore. And all his pots of wildfire didn't help him, did they? Men win wars, not magic tricks.",5,2,22
14619,bronn, m,bronn, This is a shit idea.,5,2,5
14620,bronn, m,bronn," Careful, now. We don't want to get blood all over your pretty white cloak.",4,2,14
14621,bronn, m,bronn, The little king's backed up. Clogged from balls to brains.,4,2,10
14622,bronn, m,bronn, There's no cure for being a cunt. But the boy's at that age. And he's got nothing to do all day but pick wings off flies. Couldn't hurt to get some of the poison out.,4,2,35
14623,bronn, m,bronn,  What the fuck were you doing back there?,5,7,8
14624,bronn, m,bronn,  You saw the dragon between you and her?,5,7,8
14625,bronn, m,bronn,  And?,5,7,1
14626,bronn, m,bronn,"  Listen to me, cunt.  Till I get what I'm owed, a dragon doesn't get to kill you.  You don't get to kill you.  Only I get to kill you.",5,7,29
14627,bronn, m,bronn,  You're fucked.,5,7,2
14628,bronn, m,bronn,"  No, I do not.  Dragons are where our partnership ends.  I'm not going to be around when those things start spitting fire on King's Landing.",5,7,25
14629,bronn, m,bronn,  Best well jump back in that river.,5,7,7
14630,bronn, m,bronn,  All the more reason for you to train.  Unless you plan on fighting Dothraki 12 year olds.,5,7,17
14631,bronn, m,bronn,  And here I am ready to train.,5,7,7
14632,bronn, m,bronn,  I don't think you want people to see how you look swinging that thing yet.,5,7,15
14633,bronn, m,bronn,"  Oh, you won't be swinging it at me.",5,7,8
14634,bronn, m,bronn,  I'll leave you to it.,5,7,5
14635,bronn, m,bronn,  You just won the biggest prize in the world.  What could you possibly have to be upset about?  Come on.  You can tell me.  Queen of Thorns give you one last prick in the balls before saying goodbye?,4,7,38
14636,bronn, m,bronn,  There is no more High Septon.,4,7,6
14637,bronn, m,bronn,  There is still the question of my prize.,4,7,8
14638,bronn, m,bronn,  It's not a castle.,4,7,4
14639,bronn, m,bronn,  How about that one?  It's available.,4,7,6
14640,bronn, m,bronn,  I beg to differ.,4,7,4
14641,bronn, m,bronn,"  Oh, is that why you're so fucking glum, eh?  All your new riches weighing you down?",4,7,16
14642,bronn, m,bronn,  Right.  Just not to me.,4,7,5
14643,bronn, m,bronn,"  Yes, I'm sure Queen Cersei's reign will be quiet and peaceful.",4,7,11
14644,bronn, m,bronn,  Like what?,4,7,2
14645,bronn, m,bronn,  I'm not much for shoveling weight.,4,7,6
14646,bronn, m,bronn,  Come on.  Your father's not here.,4,7,6
14647,bronn, m,bronn,  Men shit themselves when they die.  Didn't they teach you that at fancy lad school?,4,7,15
14648,bronn, m,bronn,"  Well, I learned it when I was 5.",4,7,8
14649,bronn, m,bronn,  Listen.,4,7,1
14650,bronn, m,bronn,  In line now!,4,7,3
14651,bronn, m,bronn,  Get back to King's Landing.,4,7,5
14652,bronn, m,bronn,"  You're a commander, not a damned infantryman.  These fuckers are about to swamp us.",4,7,14
14653,bronn, m,bronn,  Go get it then.,4,7,4
14654,bronn, m,bronn,  Where are you?,4,7,3
14655,bronn, m,bronn,  Come on you fucker.,4,7,4
14656,bronn, m,bronn, Oil?,7,7,1
14657,bronn, m,bronn, How many barrels?,7,7,3
14658,bronn, m,bronn, Get 500 more.,7,7,3
14659,bronn, m,bronn," I still enjoy it when they call me ""my lord.""",7,7,10
14660,bronn, m,bronn, If we live that long. Men without cocks. You wouldn't find me fighting in an army if I had no cock. What's left to fight for?,7,7,26
14661,bronn, m,bronn, I spent my life around soldiers. What do you think they spend that gold on?,7,7,15
14662,bronn, m,bronn," Not without a cock, you don't.",7,7,6
14663,bronn, m,bronn," Yet, your brother--",7,7,3
14664,bronn, m,bronn, I think we're about to be the downtrodden.,7,7,8
14665,bronn, m,bronn," Welcome, my lords. Your friends arrived before you did.",7,7,9
14666,bronn, m,bronn, I've been sent to escort you all to the meeting.,7,7,10
14667,bronn, m,bronn, Come on! You can suck his magic cock later.,7,7,9
14668,bronn, m,bronn, I'm sure your new queen--,7,7,5
14669,bronn, m,bronn, Don't you worry about me. I'm doing all right. Looking after myself.,7,7,12
14670,bronn, m,bronn," I put yourself at risk. Important difference. It's your head Queen Cersei's offered a bag of gold for, it's not mine. Now, thanks to me, she's got two traitors' heads coming right through her door. She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes. All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater. If that's not looking after myself, I don't know what is.",7,7,76
14671,bronn, m,bronn," Yeah, you, too.",7,7,3
14672,bronn, m,bronn," Come on, Pod. Let's you and me go have a drink while the fancy folks talk, eh?",7,7,17
14673,bronn, m,bronn, I am the only man you ever met who shot a dragon.,1,8,12
14674,bronn, m,bronn, Nearly killed it.,1,8,3
14675,bronn, m,bronn," All right, can we stop talking about the fucking dragons now?",1,8,11
14676,bronn, m,bronn, You're kidding me.,1,8,3
14677,bronn, m,bronn," Sorry, ladies. Another time perhaps.",1,8,5
14678,bronn, m,bronn, Which girl?,1,8,2
14679,bronn, m,bronn," She once gave me a castle and a wife, then rectified me right out of them.",1,8,16
14680,bronn, m,bronn," So, she wants to murder someone, but she can't send her soldiers. If it's the Dragon Queen she's after-",1,8,19
14681,bronn, m,bronn," Yeah, well, good luck with that.",1,8,6
14682,bronn, m,bronn, That fucking family.,1,8,3
14683,bronn, m,bronn," I knew you were fucking her. A pair of tall, blond toffs. Must be like looking in the mirror.",4,8,19
14684,bronn, m,bronn," Oh, this? This is for you. For both of you.",4,8,10
14685,bronn, m,bronn, You boys are a pair of gold-plated cunts. Do you know that?,4,8,12
14686,bronn, m,bronn, Thanks to me. And that title's worth as much as a blond hair from your brother's ballsack.,4,8,17
14687,bronn, m,bronn, Shut your mouth.,4,8,3
14688,bronn, m,bronn," I've never hit a dwarf before, but say another word and I will belt you.",4,8,15
14689,bronn, m,bronn," You couldn't do it on your best day, you one-handed fuck. And your best days are long gone.",4,8,18
14690,bronn, m,bronn, I did not break your nose.,4,8,6
14691,bronn, m,bronn," Because I've been breaking noses since I was your size, and I know what it sounds like. Now listen. Your sister offered me Riverrun. Nice big castle, good lands, plenty of peasants who do what they're told.",4,8,37
14692,bronn, m,bronn," I knew your sister was dead the second I saw those dragons. Now, your army may be torn to shit, but I'd still bet on your Dragon Queen to win. And it just so happens I'm a betting man. If Cersei's dead, she can't pay up.",4,8,46
14693,bronn, m,bronn," Mmm, that's good. Of course, the odds change if the Dragon Queen's Hand turns up dead. Maybe a few of her top generals get picked off one by one. All of a sudden -",4,8,34
14694,bronn, m,bronn, Why not? Only death will shut you up.,4,8,8
14695,bronn, m,bronn," If anyone offered me money to kill you, you'd pay me double. What's double Riverrun?",4,8,15
14696,bronn, m,bronn," The way I see it, I only need one of the Lannister brothers alive.",4,8,14
14697,bronn, m,bronn," No? Who were your ancestors, the ones who made your family rich? Fancy lads in silk? They were fucking cutthroats. That's how all the great houses started, isn't it? With a hard bastard who was good at killing people. Kill a few hundred people, they make you a lord. Kill a few thousand, they make you king. And then all your cocksucking grandsons can ruin the family with their cocksucking ways.",4,8,71
14698,bronn, m,bronn, Highgarden. Give me your word.,4,8,5
14699,bronn, m,bronn, Your Grace.,6,8,2
14700,bronn, m,bronn," The farther away, the better.",6,8,5
14701,bronn, m,bronn, Long may he reign.,6,8,4
14702,bronn, m,bronn," In full, my lord Hand.",6,8,5
14703,bronn, m,bronn, Indeed we can.,6,8,3
14704,bronn, m,bronn," The Master of Coin looks forward to helping the Master of Ships, but first he has to ensure we're not wasting coin, or soon there won't be no more coin.",6,8,30
14705,bronn, m,bronn, You Master of Grammar now too?,6,8,6
14706,bronn, m,bronn, The strong live and the weak don't.,6,8,7
14707,bronn, m,bronn," Oh, speaking of builders, all the best brothels burned down. The Master of Coin is willing to fund reconstruction.",6,8,19
14708,bronn, m,bronn," Well, I imagine he isn't using them properly.",6,8,8
14709,bronn, m,bronn, I think that's a very presumptuous statement.,6,8,7
14710,bronn, m,bronn,  l took her.,9,1,3
14711,bronn, m,bronn,"  From, uh, Ser What's-his-name? l don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down.",9,1,12

14713,bronn, m,bronn,"  Oh, well. l, uh, think l'll go and find myself one.",9,1,11
14714,bronn, m,bronn,   Drink.,9,1,1
14715,bronn, m,bronn,  There's a Braavosi knife game l could teach you.,9,1,9
14716,bronn, m,bronn,  Not if you win.,9,1,4
14717,bronn, m,bronn,  This sounds like a boring game.,9,1,6
14718,bronn, m,bronn,  But my mother hit harder.,9,1,5
14719,bronn, m,bronn,"  lt was a woman. (Tyrion drinks. Shae looks at Bronn, surprised.) She swung an axe at me.",9,1,17
14720,bronn, m,bronn,  Work.,9,1,1
14721,bronn, m,bronn,  The whole shit-stained world could drink off that one.,9,1,9
14722,bronn, m,bronn,  Our lord here used to be married.,9,1,7
14723,bronn, m,bronn,  You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.,9,1,10
14724,bronn, m,bronn,  l'm guessing the lady and l can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship.,9,1,14
14725,bronn, m,bronn,"  For three chickens, l should hope so.",9,1,7
14726,bronn, m,bronn,"  Well, l imagine that was the end of all that.",9,1,10
14727,bronn, m,bronn,  l would have killed the man who did that to me.,9,1,11
14728,bronn, m,bronn,  You're sleeping through the war.,9,1,5
14729,bronn, m,bronn,  They stole a night's march on us. They're a mile north.,9,1,11
14730,bronn, m,bronn,  You don't have a squire.,9,1,5
14731,bronn, m,bronn,  Stay low.,9,1,2
14732,bronn, m,bronn,"  lf you're lucky, no one will notice you.",9,1,8
14733,bronn, m,bronn,  You're a shit warrior.,9,1,4
14734,bronn, m,bronn,  You're alive.,9,1,2
14735,bronn, m,bronn,  We wouldn't be having this conversation if we didn't.,9,1,9
14736,bronn, m,bronn,"  Yeah, good.",9,1,2
14737,bronn, m,bronn,  Will you shut up? There's hill tribes all around here.,8,1,10
14738,bronn, m,bronn,  I should just take your food and leave you here.,8,1,10
14739,bronn, m,bronn,"  You don't think I'd do it, do you?",8,1,8
14740,bronn, m,bronn,  Fair enough.,8,1,2
14741,bronn, m,bronn,  Tyrion. Tyrion. Tyrion.,8,1,3
14742,bronn, m,bronn,  You wouldn't know him.,8,1,4
14743,bronn, m,bronn,  Your first? You need a woman. Nothing like a woman after a fight.,5,1,13
14744,bronn, m,bronn, Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes... I'll impregnate the bitch.,5,1,13

14747,bronn, m,bronn, No. He did.,6,1,3
14748,bronn, m,bronn," Getting a bit old to be a squire, aren’t we?",8,6,10
14749,bronn, m,bronn, Podrick fucking Payne. I thought you’d be dead by now.,8,6,10
14750,bronn, m,bronn, Are they in there?,8,6,4
14751,bronn, m,bronn, You think they’re fucking?,8,6,4
14752,bronn, m,bronn," Why not? I’d fuck her. You’d fuck her, wouldn’t you?",8,6,10
14753,bronn, m,bronn," Oh. Well, he’d fuck her, that’s for sure. And she’s fuck him, don’t you think? The way she looks at him. The way all women look at him is frankly irritating. I preferred working with the little brother on that account. Come on, you’re the one with the magic cock.",8,6,50
14754,bronn, m,bronn, You must have shown it to her by now.,8,6,9
14755,bronn, m,bronn, Is she? Oh.,8,6,3
14756,bronn, m,bronn, Then how come an old cunt like me can still sneak up and murder you?,8,6,15
14757,bronn, m,bronn," Now, that’s the truth, isn’t it? You want to learn that sort of fighting?",8,6,14

14762,bronn, m,bronn," You don’t even have to do anything, do you?",10,6,9
14763,bronn, m,bronn," You just sit there, a rich slab of beef, and all the birds come pecking.",10,6,15

14768,bronn, m,bronn, Fuck it.,10,6,2
14769,bronn, m,bronn, No need to call me ser just because I’m an anointed knight.,10,6,12
14770,bronn, m,bronn," Now, that is a sorry attempt at a siege. Someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches.",7,6,20
14771,bronn, m,bronn," Oh, no. Not me. I’m just an upjumped sellsword.",7,6,9
14772,bronn, m,bronn," Aye, knights don’t get paid.",7,6,5
14773,bronn, m,bronn, That’s like saying I have a bigger cock than anyone in the Unsullied army.,7,6,14
14774,bronn, m,bronn, You promised me a lordship and a castle and a highborn beauty for a wife.,7,6,15
14775,bronn, m,bronn, Don’t say it. Don’t fucking say it.,7,6,7
14776,bronn, m,bronn, Good thing we’re friends or we’d be fucking you in the ass right now.,7,6,14
14777,bronn, m,bronn, Have your lads start digging perimeter trenches. Set pickets every hundred yards. And work double-time on those siege towers and trebuchets.,7,6,21

14895,cersei, f,cersei," Ah, but you know the song 'The Rains of Castamere'?",8,3,10
14896,cersei, f,cersei, So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere?,8,3,10
14897,cersei, f,cersei, House Reyne was a powerful family. Very wealthy. The second wealthiest in Westeros. Aren't the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now?,8,3,23
14898,cersei, f,cersei,"  Of course, ambitious climbers don't want to stop on the second highest rung. If only you could take that final step, you'd see further than all the rest. You'd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you. So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock. He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore. And finally one day, he rebelled against my father. Do you know where House Reyne is now?",8,3,78
14899,cersei, f,cersei," Gone. A gentle word. Why not say slaughtered? Every man, woman, and child put to the sword.",8,3,17
14900,cersei, f,cersei," I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock. My father let them rot up there all summer. It was a long summer. 'And now the rains weep o'er their halls, and not a soul to hear.'",8,3,41
14901,cersei, f,cersei," If you ever call me sister again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep.",8,3,14

14904,cersei, f,cersei, Nobody cares what your father once told you.,8,3,8
14905,cersei, f,cersei, A joke. Joffrey did not mean it.,10,3,7
14906,cersei, f,cersei, Let him make his threats. Hmm? He's a bitter little man.,10,3,11
14907,cersei, f,cersei, Come along.,10,3,2
14908,cersei, f,cersei, We have so much to celebrate. A wedding to plan. You must rest.,10,3,13
14909,cersei, f,cersei, Come.,10,3,1
14910,cersei, f,cersei, Leave.,10,3,1
14911,cersei, f,cersei," So, enjoying married life? An unhappy wife is a wine merchant's best friend.",10,3,13
14912,cersei, f,cersei, Deserve? Be careful with that. Start trying to work out who deserves what and before long you'll spend the rest of your days weeping for each and every person in the world.,10,3,32
14913,cersei, f,cersei, (chuckles),10,3,1
14914,cersei, f,cersei, I won't be marrying Ser Loras.,10,3,6
14915,cersei, f,cersei, You're not me. You want to make things better for Sansa? Give her a child.,10,3,15
14916,cersei, f,cersei, So she can have some happiness in her life.,10,3,9

14918,cersei, f,cersei, Until we've dealt with all our enemies.,10,3,7
14919,cersei, f,cersei, Then I suppose it will go on for quite a long time.,10,3,12
14920,cersei, f,cersei, (chuckles),3,3,1
14921,cersei, f,cersei, I have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge.,3,3,11
14922,cersei, f,cersei, That's better. It makes you look very strong.,2,3,8
14923,cersei, f,cersei, Looks like a Tyrell rose. Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown. Should be more than enough fabric.,2,3,19
14924,cersei, f,cersei, Tell me what you think of her.,2,3,7
14925,cersei, f,cersei, Margaery.,2,3,1
14926,cersei, f,cersei," It is a good match, but what do you think of her? She's beautiful and intelligent.",2,3,16
14927,cersei, f,cersei, Her concern with the well-being of the common people is interesting.,2,3,11
14928,cersei, f,cersei, I only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself.,2,3,13
14929,cersei, f,cersei, Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason. She dresses like a harlot for a reason. She married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason.,2,3,30
14930,cersei, f,cersei, You need to ask yourself,2,3,5
14931,cersei, f,cersei," Protecting me, I assume. Will you let me in?",1,3,9
14932,cersei, f,cersei," If I wanted to kill you, do you think I'd let a wooden door stop me?",1,3,16
14933,cersei, f,cersei," I'm not afraid of you, little brother.",1,3,7
14934,cersei, f,cersei," I wanted to see your face. They said you'd lost your nose, but it's not as gruesome as all that.",1,3,20
14935,cersei, f,cersei," I should hope so. The rebels came for Joffrey's head, they lost their own. Thanks to Father.",1,3,17
14936,cersei, f,cersei, No? Curious. Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand. But then I don't suppose you need much room.,1,3,20
14937,cersei, f,cersei, You're meeting Father today?,1,3,4
14938,cersei, f,cersei, Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ. The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two. Father told me. What do you want from him?,1,3,28
14939,cersei, f,cersei, You're going to make me cry.,1,3,6
14940,cersei, f,cersei, Because you've slandered me to Father before.,1,3,7
14941,cersei, f,cersei, You told him I had my guards beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock.,1,3,14
14942,cersei, f,cersei," I was nine, too.",1,3,4
14943,cersei, f,cersei," If I remember correctly, she never stole a necklace again.",1,3,10
14944,cersei, f,cersei, And what's this truth you plan on telling him today?,1,3,10
14945,cersei, f,cersei," Because you're a liar. I expect you'll tell lies about me, about Joffrey.",1,3,13
14946,cersei, f,cersei," You're a clever man, but you're not half as clever as you think you are.",1,3,15
14947,cersei, f,cersei," Yes, it suits you perfectly. I imagine you might be rather cold.",1,3,12
14948,cersei, f,cersei, You might find a bit of armor quite useful once you become queen. Perhaps before. Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom on your way back from the sept this morning.,1,3,34
14949,cersei, f,cersei," You're right, of course. But you are your father's son. We can't all have a king's bravery.",1,3,17
14950,cersei, f,cersei, I'm sure she does.,1,3,4
14951,cersei, f,cersei, Lord Baelish.,5,3,2
14952,cersei, f,cersei, I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.,5,3,10
14953,cersei, f,cersei, I have reason to believe that House Tyrell do not hold the crown's best interests at heart.,5,3,17
14954,cersei, f,cersei, My father's a practical man. He appreciates facts.,5,3,8
14955,cersei, f,cersei," And he appreciates those who aid his family, as you well know. He's almost as generous to those who help us as he is unpleasant towards those who don't. You have a good working relationship with the Tyrells. I thought you might look into it before you leave the capital.",5,3,50
14956,cersei, f,cersei, Thank you. And your best will prove better than when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?,5,3,17
14957,cersei, f,cersei," (amused) Yes, it is.",5,3,4
14958,cersei, f,cersei," She's flowered, I assure you. She and I have discussed it at length.",5,3,13
14959,cersei, f,cersei, You should be thanking the gods for this. This is more than you deserve.,5,3,14
14960,cersei, f,cersei, What do you mean?,5,3,4
14961,cersei, f,cersei, I will not.,5,3,3
14962,cersei, f,cersei," No, I won't do it.",5,3,5
14963,cersei, f,cersei," I am Queen Regent, not some broodmare.",5,3,7
14964,cersei, f,cersei," Father, don't make me do it again, please.",5,3,8
14965,cersei, f,cersei," The ceremony is traditionally held in the main sanctum, which seats 700 comfortably",4,3,13
14966,cersei, f,cersei, There aren't more than 700 people of any importance.,4,3,9
14967,cersei, f,cersei, Are you sure Lady Margaery doesn't find all this a bit macabre?,4,3,12
14968,cersei, f,cersei, Yes.,4,3,1
14969,cersei, f,cersei, Seems like a lifetime ago.,4,3,5
14970,cersei, f,cersei," No, he wanted his remains returned to Storm's End.",4,3,9
14971,cersei, f,cersei, A fairly predictable tragedy. Hunting and drinking don't mix.,4,3,9
14972,cersei, f,cersei, I seem to recall he laid siege to Storm's End for the better part of a year.,4,3,17
14973,cersei, f,cersei, (chuckles),4,3,1
14974,cersei, f,cersei, And yet the world belongs to them.,4,3,7
14975,cersei, f,cersei, The gods have seen fit to make it so.,4,3,9
14976,cersei, f,cersei, Joffrey. Wait.,4,3,2
14977,cersei, f,cersei," Yes, about Jaime.",4,3,3
14978,cersei, f,cersei, I wanted to make sure we're doing everything we can to get him back.,4,3,14
14979,cersei, f,cersei, You started a war.,4,3,4
14980,cersei, f,cersei, Whatever you can.,4,3,3
14981,cersei, f,cersei, Yes.,4,3,1
14982,cersei, f,cersei, The Tyrells are a problem.,4,3,5
14983,cersei, f,cersei, Margaery has her claws in Joffrey. She knows how to manipulate him.,4,3,12
14984,cersei, f,cersei, Perhaps you should try stopping him from doing what he likes.,4,3,11
14985,cersei, f,cersei, We can have them both killed.,6,3,6
14986,cersei, f,cersei, Father doesn't discriminate. We're all being shipped off to hell together.,6,3,11
14987,cersei, f,cersei, The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family. I did what I did to protect our family.,6,3,17
14988,cersei, f,cersei," I do admit it. If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here. Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate.",6,3,33
14989,cersei, f,cersei, What do you want me to say?,6,3,7
14990,cersei, f,cersei, Probably. But not from Joffrey. He won't do anything now Father's here.,6,3,12
14991,cersei, f,cersei," Not the Tyrells. Soon they won't need to be afraid of him. Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore. And so will his children and their children. History will be taken from our hands.",6,3,36
14992,cersei, f,cersei," When Jaime gets back, yes. But when do we think that's going to be? He's out there somewhere.",6,3,18
14993,cersei, f,cersei, Who's going to tell her?,6,3,5
14994,cersei, f,cersei, Bloody Martells.,10,4,2
14995,cersei, f,cersei," You're dismissed, Grand Maester.",10,4,4
14996,cersei, f,cersei, Not anymore.,10,4,2
14997,cersei, f,cersei, You can save him?,10,4,4
14998,cersei, f,cersei, Do everything you can. Come to me with anything you need.,10,4,11
14999,cersei, f,cersei, Will it weaken him?,10,4,4
15000,cersei, f,cersei, Very well then.,10,4,3
15001,cersei, f,cersei, I'm opening it again.,10,4,4
15002,cersei, f,cersei, I will not.,10,4,3
15003,cersei, f,cersei," I don't care. I will stay in King's Landing where I belong with my son, the king.",10,4,17
15004,cersei, f,cersei, I'm not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories about the time you won. This isn't going to be one of those times.,10,4,25
15005,cersei, f,cersei," When you marched into the throne room to tell me we'd won the Battle at Blackwater, do you remember?! I was sitting on the iron throne with Tommen. I was about to give him essence of nightshade, that's how far I was willing to go when I thought someone awful had come to take my son away. Someone awful is coming to take him away.",10,4,65
15006,cersei, f,cersei," Joffrey is dead. Myrcella's been sold like livestock. And now you want to ship me off to Highgarden and steal my boy, my last boy. Margaery will dig her claws in and you will dig your claws in and you will fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart. I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen.",10,4,64
15007,cersei, f,cersei, I'll tell everyone the truth.,10,4,5
15008,cersei, f,cersei," You don't know, do you? You never believed it. How is that possible? What am I saying, of course it's possible. How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing? We were right there in front of you and you didn't see us. One look in the past twenty years, one real look and you would've known.",10,4,68
15009,cersei, f,cersei, Everything they say is true. About Jaime and me.,10,4,9
15010,cersei, f,cersei, Your legacy is a lie.,10,4,5
15011,cersei, f,cersei, Yes you do.,10,4,3
15012,cersei, f,cersei, Jaime.,10,4,1
15013,cersei, f,cersei," For my family, no. I would do things for my family you couldn't imagine.",10,4,14
15014,cersei, f,cersei, He's not.,10,4,2
15015,cersei, f,cersei," I do, so do you. You can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world-",10,4,19
15016,cersei, f,cersei," A disease doesn't decide to kill you, all the same you cut it out before it does. What do you decide? What do you choose?",10,4,25
15017,cersei, f,cersei, I choose you.,10,4,3
15018,cersei, f,cersei, Yes. Like the ones I just said to father. I told him.,10,4,12
15019,cersei, f,cersei, I told him about us.,10,4,5
15020,cersei, f,cersei," I told him I wouldn't marry Loras Tyrell. I told him I'm staying right here with Tommen, with you.",10,4,19
15021,cersei, f,cersei, Go and ask him.,10,4,4
15022,cersei, f,cersei," I don't want to talk about Tywin Lannister. I don't choose Tywin Lannister, I don't love Tywin Lannister. I love my brother. I love my lover. People will whisper, they'll make their jokes. Let them. They're all so small I can't even see them. I only see what matters.",10,4,49
15023,cersei, f,cersei, I don't care.,10,4,3
15024,cersei, f,cersei, You did this. You did this!,3,4,6
15025,cersei, f,cersei, Take him! Take him!,3,4,4
15026,cersei, f,cersei, Where is his wife? Where's Sansa?,3,4,6
15027,cersei, f,cersei, Where is she?!,3,4,3
15028,cersei, f,cersei, This is hardly the place or the time.,3,4,8
15029,cersei, f,cersei," It was Tyrion. He killed him. He told me he would. ""A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth."" That's what he said to me. You saw it. You saw Joff point at him just before he...",3,4,51
15030,cersei, f,cersei, Avenge him. Avenge our son. Kill Tyrion.,3,4,7
15031,cersei, f,cersei," I don't want a trial. He'll squirm his way to freedom given the chance. I want him dead. (CRYING) Please, Jaime. You have to. He was our son. Our baby boy.",3,4,31
15032,cersei, f,cersei," Jaime, not here, please. Please.",3,4,5
15033,cersei, f,cersei, Stop it. Stop it. Stop.,3,4,5
15034,cersei, f,cersei, Stop it. Stop.,3,4,3
15035,cersei, f,cersei, Stop.  Stop. It's not right.,3,4,5
15036,cersei, f,cersei, It's not right. It's not right.,3,4,6
15037,cersei, f,cersei, (CRYING)  Don't.,3,4,2
15038,cersei, f,cersei," Don't. Jaime, don't.",3,4,3
15039,cersei, f,cersei, She's the whore I told you about. The dark-haired one.,2,4,10
15040,cersei, f,cersei, He saw us.,2,4,3
15041,cersei, f,cersei, You're an example to us all.,2,4,6
15042,cersei, f,cersei, Did you just bow?,2,4,4
15043,cersei, f,cersei, Lady Brienne. You're Lord Selwyn Tarth's daughter. That makes you a lady whether you want to be or not.,2,4,19
15044,cersei, f,cersei, I owe you my gratitude. You returned my brother safely to King's Landing.,2,4,13
15045,cersei, f,cersei, Did he? Haven't heard that story before.,2,4,7
15046,cersei, f,cersei, I'm sure you have many fascinating stories. Sworn to Renly Baratheon. Sworn to Catelyn Stark. And now my brother. Must be exciting to flit from one camp to the next serving whichever lord or lady you fancy.,2,4,37
15047,cersei, f,cersei, But you love him.,2,4,4
15048,cersei, f,cersei,  She'll do no such thing.,2,4,5
15049,cersei, f,cersei, You should see Qyburn. He's quite good.,2,4,7
15050,cersei, f,cersei, More repugnant than your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs?,2,4,10
15051,cersei, f,cersei, My little brother had you sent to the Black Cells when you annoyed him. What do you think I could do to you if you annoyed me?,2,4,27
15052,cersei, f,cersei, But you are. You annoy me right now. Every breath you draw in my presence annoys me. So here's what I want you to do. I want you to leave my presence. Leave this wedding right now. Go to the kitchens and instruct them that all the leftovers from the feast will be brought to the kennels.,2,4,57
15053,cersei, f,cersei, The queen is telling you the leftovers will feed the dogs or you will.,2,4,14
15054,cersei, f,cersei, I suppose I am.,2,4,4
15055,cersei, f,cersei, Small pleasures.,2,4,2
15056,cersei, f,cersei, Can't say I've ever met a Sand before.,2,4,8
15057,cersei, f,cersei, No? How tolerant of you.,2,4,5
15058,cersei, f,cersei," I suppose you'll never know, Prince Oberyn. It's a shame your older brother couldn't attend the wedding.",2,4,17
15059,cersei, f,cersei,  Help him! Someone help him!,2,4,5
15060,cersei, f,cersei, Joffrey!,2,4,1
15061,cersei, f,cersei, Joffrey! Joffrey!,2,4,2
15062,cersei, f,cersei, Don't touch him!,2,4,3
15063,cersei, f,cersei," Joffrey. Please, Joffrey. Joffrey, what is it? Help him!",2,4,9
15064,cersei, f,cersei, My son.,2,4,2
15065,cersei, f,cersei," He did this. He poisoned my son, your king. Take him. Take him! Take him! Take him!",2,4,17
15066,cersei, f,cersei," Better part of an afternoon. There, how does that feel?",1,4,10
15067,cersei, f,cersei," Elegant, I think.",1,4,3
15068,cersei, f,cersei," Gone completely. I am in your debt, Maester Qyburn.",1,4,9
15069,cersei, f,cersei,"  I've grown rather fond of him. He's quite talented, you know?",1,4,11
15070,cersei, f,cersei, Symptoms that are not your concern.,1,4,6
15071,cersei, f,cersei, You jealous?,1,4,2
15072,cersei, f,cersei, (Laughs) You think I'd let that old lecher put his hands on me? He smells like a dead cat.,1,4,19
15073,cersei, f,cersei," Well, they smell like Pycelle.",1,4,5
15074,cersei, f,cersei, Yes.,1,4,1
15075,cersei, f,cersei," Let's see, you started a brawl in the streets with Ned Stark and disappeared from the capital. My husband died in a tragic hunting accident.",1,4,25
15076,cersei, f,cersei, My only daughter was shipped off to Dorne. We suffered through a siege.,1,4,13
15077,cersei, f,cersei," A rather short siege that I didn't expect to survive. And now I'm marrying my eldest son to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden while I'm supposed to marry her brother, a renowned pillow biter. So...",1,4,36
15078,cersei, f,cersei, He can't disown you. You're all he's got.,1,4,8
15079,cersei, f,cersei," You don't really plan on staying in the Kingsguard, do you?",1,4,11
15080,cersei, f,cersei, Not now.,1,4,2
15081,cersei, f,cersei, Everything's changed. You come back after all this time with no apologies and one hand and expect everything to be the same?,1,4,22
15082,cersei, f,cersei, For leaving me.,1,4,3
15083,cersei, f,cersei, Don't know what you wanted. You weren't here. You left me alone.,1,4,12
15084,cersei, f,cersei, You took too long.,1,4,4
15085,cersei, f,cersei,  I'm saying you took too long.,1,4,6
15086,cersei, f,cersei, Come in.,1,4,2
15087,cersei, f,cersei, There he is.,5,4,3
15088,cersei, f,cersei, Long may he reign.,5,4,4
15089,cersei, f,cersei," Yes. He wasn't, though, was he?",5,4,6
15090,cersei, f,cersei, You still mourn for Joffrey?,5,4,5
15091,cersei, f,cersei, He would have been your nightmare.,5,4,6
15092,cersei, f,cersei," You knew exactly what he was. I did, too. You never love anything in the world the way you love your first child. Doesn't matter what they do. And what he did, it shocked me. Do you think I'm easily shocked?",5,4,41
15093,cersei, f,cersei," The things he did shocked me. He's only a boy. A good boy. A decent boy. He always has been. Who was the last decent king, I wonder? He could be the first man who sits on that throne in 50 years to actually deserve it.",5,4,46
15094,cersei, f,cersei, He will need help... if he's going to rule well.,5,4,10
15095,cersei, f,cersei," A mother is not enough. You're still interested in being queen, I take it?",5,4,14
15096,cersei, f,cersei," Yes, speak to your father. I'll speak to mine.",5,4,9
15097,cersei, f,cersei, (CHUCKLES),5,4,1
15098,cersei, f,cersei, As soon as decency permits. After we've allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband.,5,4,22
15099,cersei, f,cersei, That seems reasonable.,5,4,3
15100,cersei, f,cersei, (shakes her head),5,4,3
15101,cersei, f,cersei, Shortly after Tommen's.,5,4,3
15102,cersei, f,cersei, A fortnight.,5,4,2
15103,cersei, f,cersei, We had that in common.,5,4,5
15104,cersei, f,cersei, Then whom can we trust?,5,4,5
15105,cersei, f,cersei, Robert wasn't particularly rich.,5,4,4
15106,cersei, f,cersei, Haven't a clue.,5,4,3
15107,cersei, f,cersei," Pounds, tons, ounces?",5,4,3
15108,cersei, f,cersei, That can't be.,5,4,3
15109,cersei, f,cersei, Then how do we pay for anything?,5,4,7
15110,cersei, f,cersei, How much?,5,4,2
15111,cersei, f,cersei," There must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement.",5,4,16
15112,cersei, f,cersei, Someone does work there. It is comprised of people.,5,4,9
15113,cersei, f,cersei," It's for the good of the family, I understand that. I'm not sure my brothers do.",5,4,16
15114,cersei, f,cersei, I respect that. We don't need to discuss it.,5,4,9
15115,cersei, f,cersei, The Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters. You've started wars to protect this family. Turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future. What does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire?,5,4,38
15116,cersei, f,cersei, Prince Oberyn. Writing letters?,5,4,4
15117,cersei, f,cersei, May I show you the gardens?,5,4,6
15118,cersei, f,cersei," No, you couldn't.",5,4,3
15119,cersei, f,cersei, I didn't realize you were a poet.,5,4,7
15120,cersei, f,cersei, For your paramour?,5,4,3
15121,cersei, f,cersei," You have several, don't you?",5,4,5
15122,cersei, f,cersei, Eight? Eight daughters?,5,4,3
15123,cersei, f,cersei, Beautiful name.,5,4,2
15124,cersei, f,cersei," Perhaps that's why she's difficult. The gods love their stupid jokes, don't they?",5,4,13
15125,cersei, f,cersei, You're a prince of Dorne. A legendary fighter. A brilliant man feared throughout Westeros. But you could not save your sister. I'm a Lannister. Queen for 19 years. Daughter of the most powerful man alive. But I could not save my son. What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?,5,4,54
15126,cersei, f,cersei," Yes, we can avenge them.",5,4,5
15127,cersei, f,cersei, I know he did.,5,4,4
15128,cersei, f,cersei," We'll have a trial, anyway. I haven't seen my daughter in over a year.",5,4,14
15129,cersei, f,cersei, I want to believe that. I want to believe she's happy.,5,4,11
15130,cersei, f,cersei," Everywhere in the world, they hurt little girls. Would you bring her a gift for me? I wasn't there for her name day. I don't know when I'll see her again.",5,4,31
15131,cersei, f,cersei, The best shipwrights in King's Landing have been working on it for months. Myrcella loves the open water.,5,4,18
15132,cersei, f,cersei, Please tell her... her mother misses her very much.,5,4,9
15133,cersei, f,cersei, Your Grace. How formal of you. How many Kingsguards are posted outside Tommen's door?,4,4,14
15134,cersei, f,cersei, So one? You have one man guarding the future king?,4,4,10
15135,cersei, f,cersei, The way you protected Joffrey? Why did Catelyn Stark set you free?,4,4,12
15136,cersei, f,cersei,  I've been wondering for months. Ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital. Why did she set you free?,4,4,22
15137,cersei, f,cersei, She hoped or did you promise?,4,4,6
15138,cersei, f,cersei, So you made a sacred vow to the enemy.,4,4,9
15139,cersei, f,cersei," You didn't mean it, then? You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark?",4,4,12
15140,cersei, f,cersei, I know you went to see Tyrion. That creature who murdered our son.,4,4,13
15141,cersei, f,cersei,  And?,4,4,1
15142,cersei, f,cersei," You've always pitied him. Our poor little brother. Abused by the world. Despised by his father and sister. He'd kill us all if he could. I want four men at Tommen's door day and night. That will be all, Lord Commander.",4,4,41
15143,cersei, f,cersei, A coward and a traitor.,6,4,5
15144,cersei, f,cersei, Conquered with what?,6,4,3
15145,cersei, f,cersei," Baby dragons. Larger every year, Your Grace.",6,4,7
15146,cersei, f,cersei, He's an old man. He wasn't fit to protect my son.,6,4,11
15147,cersei, f,cersei, Don't tell me you're worried about a child halfway across the world.,6,4,12
15148,cersei, f,cersei," ""I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you will know the debt is paid.""",6,4,36
15149,cersei, f,cersei," (Nods.) Shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay. I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey on the front lines. As it turned out, when the attack came, Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements. He believed his presence would inspire the troops.",6,4,44
15150,cersei, f,cersei, I discovered he'd been keeping whores in the Tower of the Hand. I asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behavior belongs. He wasn't pleased.,6,4,30
15151,cersei, f,cersei, Ser Gregor. Welcome to the capital. Thank you for riding here so quickly.,7,4,13
15152,cersei, f,cersei, You seem to be in good form.,7,4,7
15153,cersei, f,cersei, Does it matter?,7,4,3
15154,cersei, f,cersei, My son. Let me speak to--,8,5,6
15155,cersei, f,cersei, My face will be the last thing you see before--,8,5,10
15156,cersei, f,cersei, The charges?,8,5,2
15157,cersei, f,cersei, All lies.,8,5,2
15158,cersei, f,cersei, I wish you’d said it sooner. Any word from Jaime?,8,5,10
15159,cersei, f,cersei, Tell him I need to speak to him.,8,5,8
15160,cersei, f,cersei," What about my son, the king? If you can visit me then surely the king--",8,5,15
15161,cersei, f,cersei," You need to talk to him, you need to talk to my son to come and see me, come and see his mother.",8,5,23
15162,cersei, f,cersei, I can’t stay here.,8,5,4
15163,cersei, f,cersei," Confess? To the High Sparrow? I won’t. I made him. I rose him up from nothing, I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness.",8,5,28
15164,cersei, f,cersei," I’ll get out of here, you realize. Before long.",8,5,9
15165,cersei, f,cersei, I can make you a wealthy woman. A lady of the court.,8,5,12
15166,cersei, f,cersei," I can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable, and all I do is sit here imagining ways for you to die.",8,5,25
15167,cersei, f,cersei," I have sinned. I see that now. How could I have been so blind for so long. I want to be clean again. I want absolution. The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high, and with its holy light--",10,5,41
15168,cersei, f,cersei," Once I’ve confessed, will I be free?",10,5,7
15169,cersei, f,cersei," The Mother have mercy then. I lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage, I confess.",10,5,17
15170,cersei, f,cersei, Lancel Lannister.,10,5,2
15171,cersei, f,cersei, I was lonely and afraid.,10,5,5
15172,cersei, f,cersei, A husband of whoring every chance he got.,10,5,8
15173,cersei, f,cersei, May the gods forgive me.,10,5,5
15174,cersei, f,cersei, No.,10,5,1
15175,cersei, f,cersei, No.,10,5,1
15176,cersei, f,cersei, I do.,10,5,2
15177,cersei, f,cersei," A lie. A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon. He wants the Throne, but his brother’s children stand in his way, so he claims they are not his brothers’. The filth. There is not one shred of truth to it. I deny it.",10,5,44
15178,cersei, f,cersei, Trial? I have confessed?,10,5,4
15179,cersei, f,cersei, I bow to the wisdom of your High Holiness. But if I might beg for just one drop of the Mother’s mercy. I haven’t seen my son… I don’t know how long it’s been. I need to see him. Please.,10,5,40
15180,cersei, f,cersei, Thank you. Thank you.,10,5,4
15181,cersei, f,cersei," I will, I will. I swear it, day and night.",10,5,10
15182,cersei, f,cersei, Am I free to go?,10,5,5
15183,cersei, f,cersei, My atonement?,10,5,2
15184,cersei, f,cersei," You look very much in love. The first days of marriage are often so blissful. She's certainly very pretty, isn't she? Like a doll, she smiles quite a lot. Do you think she's intelligent? I can't quite tell. Not that it matters.",3,5,42
15185,cersei, f,cersei, There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.,3,5,7
15186,cersei, f,cersei, (Chuckles). Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock?,3,5,8
15187,cersei, f,cersei, This is my real home now. Where my family lives.,3,5,10
15188,cersei, f,cersei," I know that. I know you do, my sweet boy.",3,5,10
15189,cersei, f,cersei, Don't you look lovely. Marriage agrees with you.,3,5,8
15190,cersei, f,cersei," No, no. I, I can't stay. I just wanted to let you know if, there is ever anything I can do for you.",3,5,23
15191,cersei, f,cersei, Tommen seems quite taken with his new queen.,3,5,8
15192,cersei, f,cersei, Good. Good. I'm glad to hear you're happy.,3,5,8
15193,cersei, f,cersei, I'll leave you to it then. (Turns to leave).,3,5,9
15194,cersei, f,cersei, There's no need for such formalities.,3,5,6
15195,cersei, f,cersei, Won’t that be a lovely day.,3,5,6
15196,cersei, f,cersei, Remember. Anything you need.,3,5,4
15197,cersei, f,cersei, You were assaulted?,3,5,3
15198,cersei, f,cersei," What do you want from us, High Septon?",3,5,8
15199,cersei, f,cersei, And where do I find this man? This High Sparrow?,3,5,10
15200,cersei, f,cersei," Nonsense, Ser Meryn. These are deeply religious people. (To a man at the bottom of some stairs). Where can I find the High Sparrow?",3,5,24
15201,cersei, f,cersei, A young man said I would find the High Sparrow back here. Where is he?,3,5,15
15202,cersei, f,cersei, Why no shoes?,3,5,3
15203,cersei, f,cersei, Is that why you came to King's Landing? To remind everyone?,3,5,11
15204,cersei, f,cersei, (Smiles). Perhaps they're right.,3,5,4
15205,cersei, f,cersei," An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the Gods in this world, wouldn't you say?",3,5,17
15206,cersei, f,cersei," The High Septon came to speak to me today. He doesn't want me to arrest you, he wants me to execute you.",3,5,22
15207,cersei, f,cersei," (After a moment). My thoughts on the matter align with your own. The High Septon's behaviour was corrosive, as was his attitude. Having a man like that reside in the Sept eats away the Faith from the inside. So now he resides in the Red Keep's dungeons instead. (The High Sparrow looks up at her surprised). The Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. If one collapses, so does the other. We must do everything necessary to protect one another.",3,5,86
15208,cersei, f,cersei," Send a raven with this message to Littlefinger in the Eyrie, or wherever he's slithering about. (Hands him the letter).",3,5,20
15209,cersei, f,cersei, How's your work coming along?,3,5,5
15210,cersei, f,cersei, You've made progress?,3,5,3
15211,cersei, f,cersei," Very good. I'll leave you to it then. Make sure Littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word ""immediately"".",3,5,20
15212,cersei, f,cersei," Of course it’s a threat! Our daughter’s in Dorne surrounded by people who hate our family. (mocking) ""It's a threat.""",2,5,20
15213,cersei, f,cersei," They blame us for the death of Oberyn and his sister, and every other tragedy that’s befallen their cursed country. I will burn their cities to the ground if they touch her!",2,5,32
15214,cersei, f,cersei, What?,2,5,1
15215,cersei, f,cersei," Our daughter’s in danger, and you’re worried I’m speaking too loudly!",2,5,11
15216,cersei, f,cersei, Then don’t call her your daughter. You’ve never been a father to her.,2,5,13
15217,cersei, f,cersei, And what has your caution brought? Our eldest child murdered at his own wedding. Our only daughter shipped off to Dorne. Our baby boy sent to marry that smirking whore from Highgarden.,2,5,32
15218,cersei, f,cersei, You never made anything better.,2,5,5
15219,cersei, f,cersei, You can’t just ask Prince Doran to give her back! She’s promised his son.,2,5,14
15220,cersei, f,cersei," You go there with an army, it’s an act of war.",2,5,11
15221,cersei, f,cersei, Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.,2,5,5
15222,cersei, f,cersei, (scoffs) You’re going to Dorne? A one-handed man? Alone?,2,5,9
15223,cersei, f,cersei, Not him.,2,5,2
15224,cersei, f,cersei," That won't be necessary, Ser Meryn. I don't want to dissuade the other hunters. Mistakes will be made.",2,5,18
15225,cersei, f,cersei, Take the head.,2,5,3
15226,cersei, f,cersei, Very good.,2,5,2
15227,cersei, f,cersei," No, Uncle. Clearly it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role. I'm merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a Hand for himself.",2,5,31
15228,cersei, f,cersei," You're a good man, Lord Tyrell, but I don't imagine you'll have the time. In addition to being Master of Ships, the king has appointed you Master of Coin.",2,5,29
15229,cersei, f,cersei, He called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled. He said he would be honored to have you represent the crown's interests in the same.,2,5,26
15230,cersei, f,cersei, The King has named Qyburn the new Master of Whisperers.,2,5,10
15231,cersei, f,cersei," The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester. That's far more than the eunuch ever had. Far more than many ever have.",2,5,20
15232,cersei, f,cersei," Uncle Kevan, in light of your position as commander of the Lannister armies, it would please the king if you would serve as his Master of War. No man living better deserves the title.",2,5,34
15233,cersei, f,cersei, The king is very busy at this moment.,2,5,8
15234,cersei, f,cersei," He is learning. On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler, he's asked me to speak on his behalf.",2,5,19
15235,cersei, f,cersei, My brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.,2,5,12
15236,cersei, f,cersei, That is not your concern as Master of War.,2,5,9
15237,cersei, f,cersei, You would abandon your king in his time of need?,2,5,10
15238,cersei, f,cersei, Why not?,1,5,2
15239,cersei, f,cersei, He’ll never know we’ve been gone.,1,5,6
15240,cersei, f,cersei, You don’t need to be afraid of my father.,1,5,9
15241,cersei, f,cersei, Yes.,1,5,1
15242,cersei, f,cersei, Of course we should.,1,5,4
15243,cersei, f,cersei, No.,1,5,1
15244,cersei, f,cersei, They said that you were terrifying. With cat’s teeth and three eyes. You’re not terrifying. You’re boring.,1,5,17
15245,cersei, f,cersei, I know you’re a witch and you can see the future. Tell me mine.,1,5,14
15246,cersei, f,cersei, This is my father’s land. My land. Tell me my future or I’ll have your two boring eyes gouged out of your head.,1,5,23
15247,cersei, f,cersei, I’ve been promised to the prince. When will we marry?,1,5,10
15248,cersei, f,cersei, But I will be queen?,1,5,5
15249,cersei, f,cersei, Will the king and I have children?,1,5,7
15250,cersei, f,cersei, That doesn’t make sense.,1,5,4
15251,cersei, f,cersei, They will keep waiting. I want a moment alone with him.,1,5,11
15252,cersei, f,cersei, They will wait.,1,5,3
15253,cersei, f,cersei," He never wanted you to be a King’s Guard, but here you are, protecting his dead body.",1,5,17
15254,cersei, f,cersei, They?,1,5,1
15255,cersei, f,cersei," They had nothing to do with it. The man who murdered our father, he tore us apart, he’s the enemy. I’ve been telling you for years, you’ve been defending him for years…",1,5,32
15256,cersei, f,cersei, ...and now our father is dead. And that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath. Did you set him free?,1,5,21
15257,cersei, f,cersei," Tyrion may be a monster but at least he killed our father on purpose. You killed him by mistake. With stupidity. You’re a man of action, aren’t you? When it occurs to you to do something you do it, nevermind the consequences. Take a look. (gestures towards Tywin) Look at the consequences. Here they are. He loved you more than anyone in this world.",1,5,64
15258,cersei, f,cersei, Thank you so much for your kind words.,1,5,8
15259,cersei, f,cersei, Cousin Lancel. I hardly recognized you.,1,5,6
15260,cersei, f,cersei," Uncle, it’s quite alright.",1,5,4
15261,cersei, f,cersei, I’m sure he’ll grow out of it. Whatever it is. Excuse me.,1,5,12
15262,cersei, f,cersei, Your wounds from the Blackwater seem to have healed.,1,5,9
15263,cersei, f,cersei, What can I do for you?,1,5,6
15264,cersei, f,cersei, What could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness?,1,5,10
15265,cersei, f,cersei, I doubt you’ve ever led anyone anywhere.,1,5,7
15266,cersei, f,cersei, I don’t know what you’re talking about.,1,5,7
15267,cersei, f,cersei, The day Tywin Lannister’s soul needs your help…,1,5,8
15268,cersei, f,cersei, How much can the Crown afford?,4,5,6
15269,cersei, f,cersei, You're the Master of Coin. How do we pay them?,4,5,10
15270,cersei, f,cersei," You've already given us too much. (Gets up and walks to a window). No, we must arrange better terms with the Iron Bank.",4,5,23
15271,cersei, f,cersei, In person.,4,5,2
15272,cersei, f,cersei," We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank, someone of importance, to show these bankers our respect. As the King's Master of Coin, I can think of no one more qualified.",4,5,32
15273,cersei, f,cersei, The King has expressed concern about his father-in-law's safety on this voyage. (Smiling). He's ordered Ser Meryn to personally lead your escort.,4,5,22
15274,cersei, f,cersei," Safe travels, Lord Tyrell.",4,5,4
15275,cersei, f,cersei, (Walking out). Not small enough.,4,5,5
15276,cersei, f,cersei," May I offer you some wine, Your Holiness?",4,5,8
15277,cersei, f,cersei, The old High Septon would have asked the vintage. (Smiles).,4,5,10
15278,cersei, f,cersei, Hmm.,4,5,1
15279,cersei, f,cersei, All over Westeros we hear about septs being burned. Silent sisters raped. Bodies of holy men piled in the streets.,4,5,20
15280,cersei, f,cersei," Perhaps the Gods need a sword of their own. (HS raises an eyebrow). In the days before the Targaryens, the Faith Militant dispensed the justice of the Seven.",4,5,28
15281,cersei, f,cersei," If I explain the holy purpose to my son, the king, I have no doubt he will sign a decree arming the believers you felt worthy.",4,5,26
15282,cersei, f,cersei," An army and service to the Gods themselves. And to you, of course. As the chosen representative of the Seven.",4,5,20
15283,cersei, f,cersei," Which is why you were chosen. (HS smiles). You and I both know how the world works. Too often the wicked are the wealthiest, beyond the reach of justice. The king himself cannot always punish those who deserve it most.",4,5,40
15284,cersei, f,cersei, (Smiles. Continues after a moment). What would you say if I told you we have a great sinner in our very midst? Shielded by gold and privilege.,4,5,27
15285,cersei, f,cersei, (Turns around). Did I arrest him?,4,5,6
15286,cersei, f,cersei," I did. And your wife has every right to criticize. (Begins walking towards her desk). Can't allow fanatics to arrest the Queen's brother, no matter his perversions.",4,5,27
15287,cersei, f,cersei," I told you I am not holding Ser Loras. You're the King. I'm sure if you speak to the High Sparrow, he'll release the poor boy.",4,5,26
15288,cersei, f,cersei, The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.,6,5,7
15289,cersei, f,cersei, The King’s orders. Is the King to blame for Ser Loras’ perversion?,6,5,12
15290,cersei, f,cersei," House Tyrell won’t tolerate it? I’m the insulted party, Lord Baelish. Ser Loras was promised to me, instead he chose the company of boys.",6,5,24
15291,cersei, f,cersei, Most curious. Lysa Arryn for instance. A sorrily repellent woman. Forgive me. I know you’re still in mourning.,6,5,18
15292,cersei, f,cersei," She was neither of those things, we both know it. Still, I pity her son. How fortunate that the young Lord of the Vale has a new father to counsel him.",6,5,31
15293,cersei, f,cersei, If war comes to Westeros will the Knights of the Veil fight for their king?,6,5,15
15294,cersei, f,cersei, Good. (Cersei gets up) If there’s nothing else.,6,5,8
15295,cersei, f,cersei, That’s not possible.,6,5,3
15296,cersei, f,cersei, Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father.,6,5,13
15297,cersei, f,cersei, We were fools to trust a turncloak.,6,5,7
15298,cersei, f,cersei, I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil.,6,5,14
15299,cersei, f,cersei," Patience? Sansa helped murder my son, Roose Bolton is a traitor.",6,5,11
15300,cersei, f,cersei," Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here. The weather has already begun to turn.",6,5,14
15301,cersei, f,cersei, My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse.,6,5,11
15302,cersei, f,cersei, Jaime is away on a sensitive diplomatic mission. I’ve no idea when he’ll be back.,6,5,15
15303,cersei, f,cersei," Forgive me Lord Baelish, you have a reputation as a money lender and brothel keeper, not a military man.",6,5,19
15304,cersei, f,cersei, And if you succeed?,6,5,4
15305,cersei, f,cersei, I’ll speak to the king this evening. Have him issue a royal decree.,6,5,13
15306,cersei, f,cersei, And I’ll l know you’re a man of your word when I see Sansa Stark’s head on a spike.,6,5,19
15307,cersei, f,cersei, You must be exhausted.,6,5,4
15308,cersei, f,cersei," Ah, yes, the famously tart-tongued queen of thorns.",6,5,8
15309,cersei, f,cersei, Beg your pardon.,6,5,3
15310,cersei, f,cersei, If you apologize for that comment perhaps--,6,5,7
15311,cersei, f,cersei, I was as shocked as anyone when The Faith arrested Ser Loras. I have no love for these fanatics. But what can the queen mother do?,6,5,26
15312,cersei, f,cersei, I assure you our alliance with House Tyrell remains--,6,5,9
15313,cersei, f,cersei," As I said, i didn’t imprison anyone. As for your veiled threats--",6,5,12
15314,cersei, f,cersei, The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country. Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?,6,5,22
15315,cersei, f,cersei," House Lannister has no rival. The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial. Just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit, which I’m sure they don’t. Loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue, and we’ll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened. Good day, Lady Olenna.",6,5,55
15316,cersei, f,cersei, This testimony is an insult to a great house. Why should The Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to Highgarden?,6,5,27
15317,cersei, f,cersei," Starving yourself won't make things any better for her, my love.",7,5,11
15318,cersei, f,cersei," No matter who you are, no matter how strong you are, sooner or later, you'll face circumstances beyond your control.",7,5,20
15319,cersei, f,cersei, You know as well as I do who the first casualty in that war would be.,7,5,16
15320,cersei, f,cersei, We must be strong for those we love. We cannot give in to despair.,7,5,14
15321,cersei, f,cersei, Let me speak to him on your behalf. The king cannot dirty sully himself negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.,7,5,19
15322,cersei, f,cersei, Your happiness is all I want in this world,7,5,9
15323,cersei, f,cersei," No you don’t. You can’t possibly. Not until you have children of your own. I would do anything for you. Anything to keep you from harm. I would burn cities to the ground. That is all that matters. You and your sister. From the moment you came into this world, my boy. My only boy.",7,5,55
15324,cersei, f,cersei," This is horrible. Unacceptable. Are they feeding you enough at least? I brought you this. Venison. It’s quite good. I had it myself for supper only last night. We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother. Tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the high sparrow, but I fear The Faith has left reason behind.",7,5,61
15325,cersei, f,cersei, We are making every effort on your behalf. I swear to you by all the seven gods.,7,5,17
15326,cersei, f,cersei, You’re upset. You’re not thinking clearly. I’ll visit again when you’ve had a chance to calm down.,7,5,17
15327,cersei, f,cersei," I do hope you change your mind about that. I’ve been told men often go mad in the Black Cells below the Red Keep, but I suppose your isolation will end once your trial begins.",7,5,35
15328,cersei, f,cersei," Yes, I’m afraid I must. My son needs me now more than ever.",7,5,13
15329,cersei, f,cersei," Sleep well, sister.",7,5,3
15330,cersei, f,cersei, Yes.,7,5,1
15331,cersei, f,cersei, Her accommodations seem sufficient. What happens to her now?,7,5,9
15332,cersei, f,cersei, Who will stand judge?,7,5,4
15333,cersei, f,cersei, Will you be one of them?,7,5,6
15334,cersei, f,cersei, If one or both of them were to confess before the trial…,7,5,12
15335,cersei, f,cersei, What does The Mother’s mercy entail?,7,5,6
15336,cersei, f,cersei, Thank you High Septon for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the Seven.,7,5,17
15337,cersei, f,cersei, I think I may have heard at one point.,7,5,9
15338,cersei, f,cersei, I’m afraid i don’t.,7,5,4
15339,cersei, f,cersei, Move. Let me go immediately.,7,5,5
15340,cersei, f,cersei, You will order her to let me go! I am the queen! I am the queen! Have you lost your mind? Let me go! You filthy… I am the queen! Let me go!,7,5,33
15341,cersei, f,cersei, Look at me. Look at my face. It’s the last thing you’ll see before you die.,7,5,16
15342,cersei, f,cersei, Your words are always wise and measured.,9,2,7
15343,cersei, f,cersei, You brought me something?,9,2,4
15344,cersei, f,cersei, I know what ten drops will bring.,9,2,7
15345,cersei, f,cersei, You may not. You must have a lot of work to do. I'm sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon.,9,2,22
15346,cersei, f,cersei, Sansa.,9,2,1
15347,cersei, f,cersei," I was wondering where our little dove had flown. You look pale, child. Is your red flower still blooming?",9,2,19
15348,cersei, f,cersei," Fitting, isn't it? The men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here. Pour Lady Sansa some wine.",9,2,20
15349,cersei, f,cersei, So? I didn't offer you water. What's he doing here?,9,2,10
15350,cersei, f,cersei," Ser llyn? He's here to defend us. When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad to have him.",9,2,21
15351,cersei, f,cersei," Guards we have paid. Should the city fall, they'll be the first ones out of the doors.",9,2,17
15352,cersei, f,cersei, The battle's first traitors. Have Ser llyn see to them. Put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning.,9,2,21
15353,cersei, f,cersei, The only way to keep the small folk loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy. Remember that if you ever hope to become a queen.,9,2,32
15354,cersei, f,cersei, He is. Traitors are a danger to us all. More wine.,9,2,11
15355,cersei, f,cersei," Sansa, come here, little dove.",9,2,5
15356,cersei, f,cersei," You're perfect, aren't you?",9,2,4
15357,cersei, f,cersei, What are you praying for?,9,2,5
15358,cersei, f,cersei, Oh. On all of us?,9,2,5
15359,cersei, f,cersei, Even me?,9,2,2
15360,cersei, f,cersei, Even Joffrey?,9,2,2
15361,cersei, f,cersei," Oh, shut up, you little fool. Praying to the gods to have mercy on us all. The gods have no mercy. That's why they're gods. My father told me that when he caught me praying. My mother had just died, you see. I didn't really understand the concept of death, the finality of it. I thought that if I prayed very, very hard, the gods would return my mother to me. I was four.",9,2,74
15362,cersei, f,cersei," He believes in them, he just doesn't like them very much.",9,2,11
15363,cersei, f,cersei, One for her.,9,2,3
15364,cersei, f,cersei, Here. Sit. Drink.,9,2,3
15365,cersei, f,cersei,"  Not like that. Drink, girl.",9,2,5
15366,cersei, f,cersei, I should have been born a man. I'd rather face a thousand swords than be shut up inside with this flock of frightened hens.,9,2,24
15367,cersei, f,cersei,"  It was expected of me, as it will be of you if you ever become Joffrey's queen. If my wretched brother should somehow prevail, these hens will return to their cocks and crow of how my courage inspired them, lifted their spirits.",9,2,42
15368,cersei, f,cersei," You'd like that, wouldn't you? The Red Keep should hold for a time, long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to Lord Stannis in person. If it were anyone else outside those gates, I might have hoped for a private audience, but this is Stannis Baratheon. I'd have a better chance of seducing his horse.",9,2,59
15369,cersei, f,cersei," Have I shocked you, little dove? Tears aren't a woman's only weapon. The best one's between your legs. Learn how to use it. Drink.",9,2,24
15370,cersei, f,cersei," Do you have any notion of what happens when a city is sacked? No, you wouldn't, would you? If the city falls, these fine women should be in for a bit of a rape. Half of them will have bastards in their bellies come the morning. You'll be glad of your red flower then. When a man's blood is up, anything with tits looks good. A precious thing like you will look very, very good. A slice of cake just waiting to be eaten.",9,2,84
15371,cersei, f,cersei, And you will be Joffrey's. Enjoy. I don't think I know this one.,9,2,13
15372,cersei, f,cersei, Pretty.,9,2,1
15373,cersei, f,cersei," That's the worst curtsy I've ever seen. Here, it's not difficult. I mastered it when I was four. Straighten your back and bend.",9,2,23
15374,cersei, f,cersei, Better. You learn fast. How long have you been in Lady Sansa's service?,9,2,13
15375,cersei, f,cersei, When did you leave Lorath?,9,2,5
15376,cersei, f,cersei, I had a Lorathi handmaiden once.,9,2,6
15377,cersei, f,cersei, But she was a nobleman's daughter. You're not. When did you come to Westeros?,9,2,14
15378,cersei, f,cersei," From Lorathi commoner to the Red Keep in 10 years, all without learning how to curtsy. I imagine that's a very interesting story. What's your name?",9,2,26
15379,cersei, f,cersei," Tell us a story, Shae.",9,2,5
15380,cersei, f,cersei, What news?,9,2,2
15381,cersei, f,cersei, Where is Joffrey?,9,2,3
15382,cersei, f,cersei, Bring him back inside at once.,9,2,6
15383,cersei, f,cersei, What?,9,2,1
15384,cersei, f,cersei, Bring him back to his chambers now.,9,2,7
15385,cersei, f,cersei, With the women and children? Do you want him to be mocked as a coward for the rest of his life?,9,2,21
15386,cersei, f,cersei, Now!,9,2,1
15387,cersei, f,cersei," When I told you about Ser llyn earlier, I lied. Do you want to hear the truth? You want to know why he's really here? He's here for us. Stannis may take the city, he may take the throne, but he will not take us alive.",9,2,46
15388,cersei, f,cersei, Where is my son?,9,2,4
15389,cersei, f,cersei, Why do I care what you want?  Bring me,9,2,9
15390,cersei, f,cersei," Shh! Be calm, my sweet.",9,2,5
15391,cersei, f,cersei, No one's going to hurt you. I'll tell you a story. You know the one about the mother lion and her little cub? They lived in the woods.,9,2,28
15392,cersei, f,cersei," Yes, my love. In the Kingswood, there lived a mother and her cub. She loved him very much. But there were other things that lived in the woods. Evil things.",9,2,30
15393,cersei, f,cersei, Like stags.,9,2,2
15394,cersei, f,cersei, And wolves.,9,2,2
15395,cersei, f,cersei," ""For one day, all the beasts will bow to you. ""You will be king. ""All the stags will bow. All the wolves will bow. ""The bears in the north and the foxes of the south, ""all the birds in the sky and the beasts in the sea, ""they will all come to you, little lion, ""to rest a crown upon your head.",9,2,62
15396,cersei, f,cersei," "" And the cub said, ""Will I be strong and fierce like my father?""",9,2,14
15397,cersei, f,cersei," ""Yes,"" said his mother. ""You will be strong and fierce just like your father.",9,2,14
15398,cersei, f,cersei," "" I will keep you safe, my love. I promise you.",9,2,11
15399,cersei, f,cersei, Father.,9,2,1
15400,cersei, f,cersei, (cries),9,2,1
15401,cersei, f,cersei, Odd little boy.,8,2,3
15402,cersei, f,cersei, You and Varys both.,8,2,4
15403,cersei, f,cersei, He's only a boy.,8,2,4
15404,cersei, f,cersei, He's not ready.,8,2,3
15405,cersei, f,cersei," Better than you. Some men have a gift for this sort of thing, some don't. His place is not on the battlefield.",8,2,22
15406,cersei, f,cersei, Do you think I'm an idiot?,8,2,6
15407,cersei, f,cersei, You shipped off my only daughter. And now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die.,8,2,20
15408,cersei, f,cersei, Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?,8,2,8
15409,cersei, f,cersei, Because he doesn't have a cock.,8,2,6
15410,cersei, f,cersei," Perhaps I'm dangerous, too. You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man. That little worm between your legs does half your thinking.",8,2,28
15411,cersei, f,cersei, (laughs),8,2,1
15412,cersei, f,cersei, Because I'm happy.,8,2,3
15413,cersei, f,cersei, Because I have your little whore.,8,2,6
15414,cersei, f,cersei," Such a droll little fellow. Tell me, have you married this one yet? No? Good. Father will be so pleased.",8,2,20
15415,cersei, f,cersei," Because a Lannister always pays her debts. You stole my only daughter, you plot to have Joffrey killed.",8,2,18
15416,cersei, f,cersei," For what? Your skill in battle? Pretty thing, your whore. Lovely body. The bruises will heal in time.",8,2,18
15417,cersei, f,cersei," Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers. Really, a Lannister lion necklace? You need to hide your secret whores more carefully.",8,2,22
15418,cersei, f,cersei," Oh? Well, you're the expert. Tell me.",8,2,7
15419,cersei, f,cersei," You're usually a better liar, baby brother. This one you like. You like her very much. Could it be love? Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough. Unless Joffrey is hurt. And then every wound he suffers, she'll suffer, too. And if he dies, there isn't a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt.",8,2,60
15420,cersei, f,cersei," Would you like to see her? I thought you might. Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore.",8,2,17
15421,cersei, f,cersei, Get out.,8,2,2
15422,cersei, f,cersei," Your Grace, in the judgment of your Small Council, it would be neither proper nor wise for you to wed the daughter of a man beheaded for treason, a girl whose brother is in open rebellion against the throne as we speak. For the good of the realm, your councilors beg you to set Sansa Stark aside.",10,2,57
15423,cersei, f,cersei," Soon, darling, when the war is over.",3,2,7
15424,cersei, f,cersei, The princess just spoke to you.,3,2,6
15425,cersei, f,cersei, He might. Would you like that?,3,2,6
15426,cersei, f,cersei," Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty. Won't you, little dove?",3,2,13
15427,cersei, f,cersei, I will not let you ship her off to Dorne as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon.,3,2,18
15428,cersei, f,cersei, Are you mad? The Martells loathe us.,3,2,7
15429,cersei, f,cersei, She'll be a hostage.,3,2,4
15430,cersei, f,cersei," You won't get away with this. You think the piece of paper Father gave you keeps you safe. Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too.",3,2,26
15431,cersei, f,cersei,  No.,3,2,1
15432,cersei, f,cersei,  No!,3,2,1
15433,cersei, f,cersei, Get out! Get out!,3,2,4
15434,cersei, f,cersei, What are you doing here?,2,2,5
15435,cersei, f,cersei, I’ve done nothing.,2,2,3
15436,cersei, f,cersei, What are you asking?,2,2,4
15437,cersei, f,cersei," “From this time until the end of time, we are not part of your realm, but a free and independent Kingdom of the North.” (Rips up the letter). He has more spirit than his father, I'll give him that.",2,2,39
15438,cersei, f,cersei," You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin?",2,2,7
15439,cersei, f,cersei, Did you see my brother when you were the Starks guest?,2,2,11
15440,cersei, f,cersei," If you speak with him, tell him he's not been forgotten.",2,2,11
15441,cersei, f,cersei, If that's everything?,2,2,3
15442,cersei, f,cersei," Another king? How many is that now, Five? I've lost count.",2,2,11
15443,cersei, f,cersei, Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war. We have no men to spare.,2,2,13
15444,cersei, f,cersei," One trip to The Wall and you come back believing in grumpkins and snarks. (Walks away, followed by Varys).",2,2,19
15445,cersei, f,cersei, I have every confidence the brave men of the Night's Watch will protect us all.,2,2,15
15446,cersei, f,cersei, Lord Janos Slynt was Commander of the City Watch. You had no right to exile him.,2,2,16
15447,cersei, f,cersei, You're serving as the King's Hand until father gets here. I am Queen Regent.,2,2,14
15448,cersei, f,cersei," Ha, the people. You think I care?",2,2,7
15449,cersei, f,cersei," He did what needed to be done. (Now loudly). You want to be the Hand of the King? You want to rule? This is what ruling is! Lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root one by one before they strangle you in your sleep.",2,2,49
15450,cersei, f,cersei," I don't care what you think! You've never taken it seriously. You haven't, Jaime hasn't. (Sits down). It's all fallen on me.",2,2,22
15451,cersei, f,cersei," You're funny. (Laughs). You've always been funny. But none of your jokes will ever match the first one, will they? You remember... back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death.",2,2,40
15452,cersei, f,cersei," Now they're gone, for the sake of you. There's no bigger joke in the world than that. (Storms out).",2,2,19
15453,cersei, f,cersei," You command the City Watch, do you not, Lord Slynt?",1,2,10
15454,cersei, f,cersei, And are you not a Lord at my command?,1,2,9
15455,cersei, f,cersei," Then do your job. Shut the gates to the peasants. They belong in the field, not our capital.",1,2,18
15456,cersei, f,cersei, What are you doing here?,1,2,5
15457,cersei, f,cersei, What are you doing here? This is the small council.,1,2,10
15458,cersei, f,cersei, Our father is Hand of the King.,1,2,7
15459,cersei, f,cersei, Out! All of you out. (The small council members all get up and leave until it is only Cersei and Tyrion. Cersei stands up and approaches Tyrion). I would like to know how you tricked father into this.,1,2,38
15460,cersei, f,cersei, I've done nothing.,1,2,3
15461,cersei, f,cersei, I tried to stop it.,1,2,5
15462,cersei, f,cersei, Robb Stark is a child.,1,2,5
15463,cersei, f,cersei, What do you know about warfare?,1,2,6
15464,cersei, f,cersei, Joffrey is King.,1,2,3
15465,cersei, f,cersei, You are here to advise him.,1,2,6
15466,cersei, f,cersei, How?,1,2,1
15467,cersei, f,cersei, One.,1,2,1
15468,cersei, f,cersei," Arya, little animal, she disappeared.",1,2,5
15469,cersei, f,cersei, Lord Baelish.,1,2,2
15470,cersei, f,cersei, I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.,1,2,10
15471,cersei, f,cersei, Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya... we can't seem to locate her.,1,2,11
15472,cersei, f,cersei, And yet my friends in the North report no sign of her.,1,2,12
15473,cersei, f,cersei," If we choose to negotiate with the Starks, the girl has some value. Whoever finds her, well, you know what they say about Lannisters and debts.",1,2,26
15474,cersei, f,cersei," A mockingbird. (Points to a pin on Baelish’s shirt). You created your own Sigil, didn't you?",1,2,16
15475,cersei, f,cersei, Appropriate for a self-made man with so many songs to sing.,1,2,11
15476,cersei, f,cersei," I heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family. He loved the eldest daughter. Sadly, she had eyes for another.",1,2,34
15477,cersei, f,cersei, And which truth is that?,1,2,5
15478,cersei, f,cersei, Seize him. (Cersei’s guards seize Baelish). Cut his throat. (A guard holds a knife to Baelish’s neck). Stop. Wait. I've changed my mind. Let him go. (The guards let Baelish go). Step back three paces. Turn around. Close your eyes. (The guards do as Cersei says). (To Baelish) Power is power. Do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the Stark girl for me. I would very much appreciate it.,1,2,79
15479,cersei, f,cersei, What is all this?,1,2,4
15480,cersei, f,cersei, We can't find Arya Stark.,1,2,5
15481,cersei, f,cersei," Perhaps. But if not, we need her. They'll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone.",1,2,17
15482,cersei, f,cersei, We need to set our armies to the task of finding her. Send out as many men as we can. I'm sure if you asked grandfather -,1,2,27
15483,cersei, f,cersei, His life is in danger.,1,2,5
15484,cersei, f,cersei, Our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne.,1,2,12
15485,cersei, f,cersei, Of course it is. No one believes this foul gossip -,1,2,11
15486,cersei, f,cersei, What are you asking?,1,2,4
15487,cersei, f,cersei, Killed? By whom?,5,2,3
15488,cersei, f,cersei, Really? Who'd have thought?,5,2,4
15489,cersei, f,cersei," Whomever did it, I say well done.",5,2,7
15490,cersei, f,cersei, Littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one.,5,2,9
15491,cersei, f,cersei," Aren't there other things you should be doing, like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away?",5,2,21
15492,cersei, f,cersei," Yes, I know how concerned you are for her safety.",5,2,10
15493,cersei, f,cersei, So clever. Aren't you always so clever with your schemes and your plots?,5,2,13
15494,cersei, f,cersei, No need to concern yourself over it. The king is taking personal charge of siege preparations.,5,2,16
15495,cersei, f,cersei," You may, specifically, or you may ask vaguely. The answer will be the same.",5,2,14
15496,cersei, f,cersei, It's the king's royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councilors.,5,2,12
15497,cersei, f,cersei," One day I pray you love someone. I pray you love her so much, when you close your eyes, you see her face. I want that for you. I want you to know what it's like to love someone, to truly love someone. Before I take her from you.",6,2,49
15498,cersei, f,cersei," Your mother might have prepared you. You flowered, my dear. No more.",7,2,12
15499,cersei, f,cersei, In what way?,7,2,3
15500,cersei, f,cersei, Wait until you birth a child.,7,2,6
15501,cersei, f,cersei, You're a woman now. Do you have any idea what that means?,7,2,12
15502,cersei, f,cersei," A prospect that once delighted you, bringing little princes and princesses into the world, the greatest honor for a queen.",7,2,20
15503,cersei, f,cersei," Joffrey has always been difficult. Even his birth, I labored a day and a half to bring him into this world. You cannot imagine the pain. I screamed so loudly, I was sure Robert would hear me in the Kingswood.",7,2,40
15504,cersei, f,cersei," Robert was hunting. That was his custom. Whenever my time was near, my royal husband would flee to the trees with his huntsmen and his hounds. And when he returned, he would present me with some pelts or a stag's head, and I would present him with a baby. Not that I wanted him there, mind you. I had Grand Maester Pycelle, an army of midwives, and I had my brother. When they told Jaime he wasn't allowed in the birthing room, he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out. Joffrey will show you no such devotion.",7,2,102
15505,cersei, f,cersei," You may never love the king, but you will love his children.",7,2,12
15506,cersei, f,cersei," That's so very touching to hear. Permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. The more people you love, the weaker you are. You'll do things for them that you know you shouldn't do. You'll act the fool to make them happy, to keep them safe. Love no one but your children. On that front, a mother has no choice.",7,2,66
15507,cersei, f,cersei," You can try, little dove.",7,2,5
15508,cersei, f,cersei, Who did you say your mother was again?,7,2,8
15509,cersei, f,cersei, Since I decided that I can't stand to look at any of my handmaidens for another instant.,7,2,17
15510,cersei, f,cersei, How many times can you read one raven scroll?,7,2,9
15511,cersei, f,cersei,  More than we have.,7,2,4
15512,cersei, f,cersei," We have strong, high walls. We'll rain fire down on them from above.",7,2,13
15513,cersei, f,cersei," Why not? He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he?",7,2,11
15514,cersei, f,cersei, I'm sure you'll make a point eventually.,7,2,7
15515,cersei, f,cersei, I'm not the one giving the boy whores to abuse.,7,2,10
15516,cersei, f,cersei, Did you?,7,2,2
15517,cersei, f,cersei, Do you think I haven't tried? He doesn't listen to me.,7,2,11
15518,cersei, f,cersei, I always hoped he'd be like Jaime. He looks like him. In a certain light.,7,2,15
15519,cersei, f,cersei," The Targaryens Wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know. That's what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt. It's what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me. Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they? What's the saying? ""Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin.""",7,2,62
15520,cersei, f,cersei,  You've proven yourself the greatest captain on the 14 seas and a true friend to the crown.,3,7,17
15521,cersei, f,cersei,  And you deserve a proper reward for your heroism.,3,7,9
15522,cersei, f,cersei,  You shall have what your heart desires --,3,7,8
15523,cersei, f,cersei,"  With Euron Greyjoy commanding our naval forces and Jaime Lannister leading our armies, the sons and daugters of Westeros shall defend our country.",3,7,23
15524,cersei, f,cersei,"  I want you to know I understand.  Even though we're enemies, you and I, I understand the fear that drives you.  I was there that day when Ser Gregor crushed your lover's head.  I close my eyes I can hear the sound of Oberyn's skull breaking.",3,7,46
15525,cersei, f,cersei,"  The sound of your scream.  I never heard a sound like that.  I thought, that's true love.  Oberyn looked beautiful that day.  He really did.  No one moved like him.  No one had such skill with a spear.  Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him.  If only he hadn't taunted him.  He could have walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die.  But that wasn't your lover's way, was it?  Now he's burried somewhere.  And here Ser Gregor is stronger than ever.  That must be difficult for you.  When my daughter was taken from me, my only daughter, well, you can't imagine how that feels unless you've lost a child.  I fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse.  I couldn't bear to see her in another woman's arms.  I never got to have a mother.  But Myrcella did.  She was mine and you took her from me.  Why did you do that?",3,7,163
15526,cersei, f,cersei,  It doesn't matter now.,3,7,4
15527,cersei, f,cersei,"  Your daughter is a beauty too.  Brown eyes, those lips.  A perfect Dornish beauty.",3,7,14
15528,cersei, f,cersei,  I imagine she is your favorite.,3,7,6
15529,cersei, f,cersei,"  I know, I know, we're not supposed to have favorites.  But still, we're only human.  We love who we love.",3,7,20
15530,cersei, f,cersei,  I'm sorry.  I can't understand you.  The gag makes it difficult to understand what you're saying.  It must be frustrating.,3,7,20
15531,cersei, f,cersei,  We all make our choices.  You chose to murder my daughter.  You must have felt powerful after you made that choice.,3,7,21
15532,cersei, f,cersei,"  Do you feel powerful now?  I don't sleep very well, not at all really.  I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy and imagine ways of killing my enemies.  How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the woman who murdered my only daughter.  I thought about having Ser Gregor crush your skull the way he did Oberyn's.  It would be poetic I suppose but fast.  Too fast.",3,7,67
15533,cersei, f,cersei,  I thought about having him crush your daughter's skull.,3,7,9
15534,cersei, f,cersei,"  She's so beautiful.  The thought of this lovely face cracking open like a duck egg, no, it's just not right.",3,7,20
15535,cersei, f,cersei,"  Qyburn, he's the cleverest man I know.  Clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder Myrcella.  The long goodbye, was that it?",3,7,24
15536,cersei, f,cersei,  That's the one.,3,7,3
15537,cersei, f,cersei,  How long does the poison take?,3,7,6
15538,cersei, f,cersei,  But death is certain?,3,7,4
15539,cersei, f,cersei,"  Your daughter will die here in this cell.  You will be here watching when she does.  You will be here the rest of your days.  If you refuse to eat we will force food down your throat.  You will live to watch your daughter rot, to watch that beautiful face collapse to bone and dust all the while contemplating the choices you've made.",3,7,63
15540,cersei, f,cersei,  Make sure the guards change the torches every few hours.  I don't want her to miss a thing.,3,7,18
15541,cersei, f,cersei,  I am queen of the Seven Kingdoms.  I'll do as I please.,3,7,12
15542,cersei, f,cersei,  Good.  And we'll need fresh sheets for the bed.,3,7,9
15543,cersei, f,cersei,  The Iron Bank didn't send you hear to offer condolences.,3,7,10
15544,cersei, f,cersei,  The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident.,3,7,11
15545,cersei, f,cersei,  The Iron Bank wants its gold back.,3,7,7
15546,cersei, f,cersei,  And we both know gold wins wars.  Your vaults are empty.  Your late husband's profligacy saw to that.,3,7,18
15547,cersei, f,cersei,  And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner.,3,7,10
15548,cersei, f,cersei,  That's a fancy way of saying bet.  The war has already begun.  I've drawn first blood.  I decapitated the Dornish snake.  My armada owns the Narrow Sea.,3,7,27
15549,cersei, f,cersei,  Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.,3,7,6
15550,cersei, f,cersei,"  Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think.  Now, let's talk about the Targaryen girl.  You want to invest in her?  I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade.  How are you profits now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?",3,7,47
15551,cersei, f,cersei,  From what I gather she considers herself more of a revolutionary that a monarch.  In your experience how do bankers usually fare with revoltionaries?,3,7,24
15552,cersei, f,cersei,  The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money but Lannisters always pay their debts.  Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?,3,7,24
15553,cersei, f,cersei,  Give me a fortnight.  Stay in King's Landing as my honored guest and when you return to Braavos I swear to you my debt will be paid in full.,3,7,29
15554,cersei, f,cersei,"  If the Mad King's daughter takes the Iron Throne, she will destroy the Realm as we know it.  Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell.  But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the Crown.  With their help the Mad King's daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores.  Mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts.  Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground, rape and enslave your women, and butcher your children without a second thought.  This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty.",2,7,97
15555,cersei, f,cersei,"  You all remember the Mad King.  You remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people.  His daughter is no different.  In Essos her brutality is already legendary.  She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slaver's Bay.  And when she grew bored of that, she fed them to her dragons.",2,7,48
15556,cersei, f,cersei,"  It is my solemn duty to protect the people, and I will but I need your help, My Lords.  We must stand together, all of us, if we hope to stop her.",2,7,32
15557,cersei, f,cersei,"  No, I can't say I have.  I haven't seen these since Robert had them removed from the Throne Room.",2,7,19
15558,cersei, f,cersei,  They were his trophies.  He couldn't keep them around.  They would have made him look small.  Sometimes he would come down here and look at them.  I believe he brought his whores on occasion.,2,7,34
15559,cersei, f,cersei," Its what we've been waiting for our whole lives. It's what Father trained us for, whether he knew it or not.",1,7,21
15560,cersei, f,cersei," It's ours now, we just have to take it.",1,7,9
15561,cersei, f,cersei, You've been quiet since you came home. Are you angry with me?,1,7,12
15562,cersei, f,cersei, Are you afraid of me?,1,7,5
15563,cersei, f,cersei," Daenerys Targaryen has chosen Tyrion to be her Hand. Right now, they're sailing across the Narrow Sea, hoping to take back her father's throne. Our little brother, the one you love so much, the one you set free, the one who murdered our father and our first-born son, now he stands beside our enemies and gives them counsel. He's out there somewhere at the head of an armada. Where will they land?",1,7,72
15564,cersei, f,cersei, Enemies to the east.,1,7,4
15565,cersei, f,cersei, Enemies to the south--Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches.,1,7,10
15566,cersei, f,cersei," Enemies to the west--Olenna, the old cunt. Another traitor.",1,7,9
15567,cersei, f,cersei, Enemies to the north. Ned Stark's bastard has been named King in the North and that murdering whore Sansa stands beside him. Enemies everywhere. We're surrounded by traitors. You're in command of the Lannister army now. How do we proceed?,1,7,40
15568,cersei, f,cersei, Will the Tyrell bannermen stand alongside a Dothraki horde and Unsullied slave soldiers?,1,7,13
15569,cersei, f,cersei, I'm the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.,1,7,7
15570,cersei, f,cersei, I understand we're in a war for survival. I understand whoever loses dies. I understand whoever wins could launch a dynasty that lasts a thousand years.,1,7,26
15571,cersei, f,cersei," A dynasty for us, then.",1,7,5
15572,cersei, f,cersei, There's nothing to say.,1,7,4
15573,cersei, f,cersei," He betrayed me. He betrayed us both. Should we spend our days mourning the dead--mother, father, and all our children?",1,7,20
15574,cersei, f,cersei," I loved them. I did. But they're ashes now and we're still flesh and blood. We're the last Lannisters, the last ones who count.",1,7,24
15575,cersei, f,cersei, I heard. How could we ever trust a man like that?,1,7,11
15576,cersei, f,cersei, You think I listened to Father for 40 years and learned nothing?,1,7,12
15577,cersei, f,cersei, Not all of them.,1,7,4
15578,cersei, f,cersei," I invited Euron Greyjoy, the new King of the Iron Islands. You said yourself we needed stronger, better allies. There you are.",1,7,22
15579,cersei, f,cersei," So does everyone when it suits them. Unlike the Freys, they have ships. And they're good at killing.",1,7,18
15580,cersei, f,cersei, Euron Greyjoy didn't come here for that.,1,7,7
15581,cersei, f,cersei, A queen.,1,7,2
15582,cersei, f,cersei, If not the most humble.,1,7,5
15583,cersei, f,cersei, What do you want in return?,1,7,6
15584,cersei, f,cersei, I decline your proposal.,1,7,4
15585,cersei, f,cersei, You're not trustworthy. You've broken promises to allies before and murdered them at the nearest opportunity. You murdered your own brother.,1,7,21
15586,cersei, f,cersei,  How many men did we lose?,5,7,6
15587,cersei, f,cersei,"  It's armies that win wars.  We have the Tyrell gold, we have the Iron Bank behind us.  We can buy mercenaries.",5,7,21
15588,cersei, f,cersei,"  They're not the same as our men but they'll fight if they're well paid, which they will be.",5,7,18
15589,cersei, f,cersei,"  So what do we do?  Sue for peace?  I sit on her father's throne, the father you betrayed and murdered.  And in her mind she's winning.  What sort of offer do you think she'd make?",5,7,35
15590,cersei, f,cersei,  Maybe we can count on Tyrion to intercede on our behalf by way of apology for murdering our father and our son.,5,7,22
15591,cersei, f,cersei,"  You saw the crossbow, you saw his body.",5,7,8
15592,cersei, f,cersei,  After all this time it still amazes me --,5,7,9
15593,cersei, f,cersei,  And this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her?,5,7,15
15594,cersei, f,cersei,  And you believed her?,5,7,4
15595,cersei, f,cersei,  I shouldn't have listened to you.  She should have died screaming.,5,7,11
15596,cersei, f,cersei,  So we fight and die or we submit and die.  I know my choice.  A soldier should know his.,5,7,19
15597,cersei, f,cersei,  That won't be necessary.,5,7,4
15598,cersei, f,cersei,  He's Hand of the Queen.  Why are you here?,5,7,9
15599,cersei, f,cersei,  What did our brother have to say?,5,7,7
15600,cersei, f,cersei,  To discuss a surrender?,5,7,4
15601,cersei, f,cersei,  She just won a great victory.  Why would she want a truce now?,5,7,13
15602,cersei, f,cersei,  Are you going to punish him?,5,7,6
15603,cersei, f,cersei,  Bronn.,5,7,1
15604,cersei, f,cersei,  He betrayed you.  He set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent.  Do you think anything of importance happens in this city without me knowing?,5,7,26
15605,cersei, f,cersei,"  I've come to believe that accomodation with the Dragon Queen could be in our immediate interest.  She has the numbers.  If we want to beat her we have to be clever.  We have to fight her like father would have.  Dead men, dragons and Dragon Queens, whatever stands in our way we will defeat it ourselves for our house.  For this.",5,7,61
15606,cersei, f,cersei,  You.,5,7,1
15607,cersei, f,cersei,  Do you remember what father used to say about people?,5,7,10
15608,cersei, f,cersei,  Never betray me again.,5,7,4
15609,cersei, f,cersei,"  You're too kind, My Lord.",4,7,5
15610,cersei, f,cersei,  Is on its way.  My brother is supervising its transportation himself.,4,7,11
15611,cersei, f,cersei,  We must devise a way to raise their spirits.,4,7,9
15612,cersei, f,cersei,  My only venture at the moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it.,4,7,17
15613,cersei, f,cersei,"  It will indeed.  I need to expand my armies, my navies.  My hand, Qyburn, had made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos.",4,7,23
15614,cersei, f,cersei,  That's good to hear.  I too would like them to recover some things that belong to me.,4,7,17
15615,cersei, f,cersei, Why isn't she with them?,7,7,5
15616,cersei, f,cersei, And the rest of them?,7,7,5
15617,cersei, f,cersei, Including our brother.,7,7,3
15618,cersei, f,cersei,"  If anything goes wrong, kill the silver-haired bitch first, then our brother, then the bastard who calls himself king.",7,7,19
15619,cersei, f,cersei, Where is she?,7,7,3
15620,cersei, f,cersei, Didn't travel with you?,7,7,4
15621,cersei, f,cersei, We've been here for some time.,7,7,6
15622,cersei, f,cersei, Sit down or leave.,7,7,4
15623,cersei, f,cersei," So instead, we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days?",7,7,18
15624,cersei, f,cersei, Then why are we here?,7,7,5
15625,cersei, f,cersei, I imagine for most of them it would be an improvement.,7,7,11
15626,cersei, f,cersei," I don't think it's serious at all. I think it's another bad joke. If my brother Jaime has informed me correctly, you're asking me for a truce.",7,7,27
15627,cersei, f,cersei, That's all? Pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt. Or while you solidify and expand your position. Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the men.,7,7,50
15628,cersei, f,cersei, The word of a would-be usurper.,7,7,6
15629,cersei, f,cersei, What are you talking about?,7,7,5
15630,cersei, f,cersei," He's right to be afraid. And a coward to run. If those things come for us, there will be no kingdoms to rule. Everything we suffered will have been for nothing. Everything we lost will have been for nothing. The crown accepts your truce. Until the dead are defeated, they are the true enemy.",7,7,54
15631,cersei, f,cersei," In return, the King",7,7,4
15632,cersei, f,cersei," (CHUCKLES) I would never ask it of you. You would never agree to it. And if you did, I would trust you even less than I do now. I ask it only of Ned Stark's son. I know Ned Stark's son.",7,7,41
15633,cersei, f,cersei, Then there is nothing left to discuss. The dead will come north first. Enjoy dealing with them. We will deal with whatever is left of you.,7,7,26
15634,cersei, f,cersei," I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose. She's your kind of woman a foreign whore who doesn't know her place.",7,7,19
15635,cersei, f,cersei," So you bring her here with her pet Northerner,  whom you've convinced to bow down before her.",7,7,17
15636,cersei, f,cersei," And now you've got them both working towards the same goal, the goal you've worked towards your entire life.",7,7,19
15637,cersei, f,cersei, the destruction of this family.,7,7,5
15638,cersei, f,cersei, You killed our father,7,7,4
15639,cersei, f,cersei," Oh, poor little man. Your papa was mean to you. Do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow? You left us open. You laid us bare for the vultures, and the vultures came and tore us apart. You may not have killed Joffrey, but you killed Myrcella, you killed Tommen. No one would've touched them if Father--",7,7,62
15640,cersei, f,cersei," I will not hear it, not from you.",7,7,8
15641,cersei, f,cersei, I will not hear it!,7,7,5
15642,cersei, f,cersei, I will not,7,7,3
15643,cersei, f,cersei, It doesn't matter. Your love doesn't matter. Your feelings don't matter. I don't care why you did what you did. I only care what it cost us. It cost us our future.,7,7,32
15644,cersei, f,cersei, Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction.,7,7,9
15645,cersei, f,cersei, What did you hope for?  To make Jon Snow submit to your queen.,7,7,13
15646,cersei, f,cersei," But eventually, you want everyone to bend the knee to her.",7,7,11
15647,cersei, f,cersei, Why?,7,7,1
15648,cersei, f,cersei, You said she'd destroy King's Landing.,7,7,6
15649,cersei, f,cersei, That's the difference between you. I don't care about checking my worst impulses. I don't care about making the world a better place. Hang the world.,7,7,26
15650,cersei, f,cersei," That thing you dragged here, I know what it is, I know what it means. And when it came at me, I didn't think about the world. Not at all. As soon as it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat. All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most, away from my family. Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea. Get on a boat, take those who matter.",7,7,83
15651,cersei, f,cersei," My armies will not stand down. I will not pull them back to the capital. I will march them north to fight alongside you in the Great War. The darkness is coming for us all. We'll face it together. And when the Great War is over, perhaps you'll remember I chose to help with no promises or assurances from any of you. I expect not. Call our banners. All of them.",7,7,71
15652,cersei, f,cersei, Ser Jaime.,7,7,2
15653,cersei, f,cersei," My lords, I need a moment with my brother.",7,7,9
15654,cersei, f,cersei, What are you doing?,7,7,4
15655,cersei, f,cersei," Expedition north? I always knew you were the stupidest Lannister. The Starks and Targaryens have united against us, and you want to fight alongside them? Are you a traitor or an idiot?",7,7,32
15656,cersei, f,cersei, I'll say whatever I need to say to ensure the survival of our house. You expect me to trust the man who murdered our father.,7,7,25
15657,cersei, f,cersei," I saw it burn. If dragons can't stop them, if Dothraki and Unsullied and Northmen can't stop them, how will our armies make a difference?",7,7,25
15658,cersei, f,cersei, And I intend to stay amongst the living. Let the Stark boy and his new queen--,7,7,16
15659,cersei, f,cersei, Our child will rule Westeros.,7,7,5
15660,cersei, f,cersei," The monsters are real. The white walkers, the dragons, the Dothraki screamers all the frightening stories we heard when we were young, they're all real. So be it. Let the monsters kill each other. And while they battle in the North, we take back the lands that belong to us.",7,7,50
15661,cersei, f,cersei, And then we rule.,7,7,4
15662,cersei, f,cersei, The Targaryens and the Starks already want to kill us all. Most of them will die in the North.,7,7,19
15663,cersei, f,cersei, How many dragons did you see at the pit?,7,7,9
15664,cersei, f,cersei, What happened to the third?,7,7,5
15665,cersei, f,cersei," She came here with her dragons and her Dothraki and her Unsullied. She came here to show us all her power. No, something happened.The dragons are vulnerable.",7,7,27
15666,cersei, f,cersei," No, we have something better. We have the Iron Bank. You should've listened more when Father--",7,7,16
15667,cersei, f,cersei, Do you really think Euron Greyjoy turned tail and sailed back to the Iron Islands? Do you think he abandoned the chance to marry the queen?,7,7,26
15668,cersei, f,cersei," And you conspired with Tyrion, the man who murdered our father without telling me, your queen.",7,7,16
15669,cersei, f,cersei, You met with him in secret without my consent. You planned to promote my enemies' interests. That is the definition of conspiracy.,7,7,22
15670,cersei, f,cersei, And that will be treason.,7,7,5
15671,cersei, f,cersei, Disobeying your queen,7,7,3
15672,cersei, f,cersei, I told you no one walks away from me.,7,7,9
15673,cersei, f,cersei,  There's one more yet to come.,7,7,6
15674,cersei, f,cersei, Good.,1,8,1
15675,cersei, f,cersei," Twenty-thousand men, is it?",1,8,4
15676,cersei, f,cersei, Horses?,1,8,1
15677,cersei, f,cersei, And elephants?,1,8,2
15678,cersei, f,cersei, That's disappointing. I was told the Golden Company had elephants.,1,8,10
15679,cersei, f,cersei," In any event, you are most welcome here in King's Landing, Captain Strickland.",1,8,13
15680,cersei, f,cersei, You are a true friend of the crown and an honored guest.,1,8,12
15681,cersei, f,cersei, After the war. That was our agreement.,1,8,7
15682,cersei, f,cersei," You want a whore, buy one. You want a queen, earn her.",1,8,12
15683,cersei, f,cersei, You're insolent. I've executed men for less.,1,8,7
15684,cersei, f,cersei, I wanted those elephants.,1,8,4
15685,cersei, f,cersei, You're insulting my late husband?,1,8,5
15686,cersei, f,cersei," Robert had a different whore every night, but he still didn't know his way around a woman's body.",1,8,18
15687,cersei, f,cersei," You enjoy risking your neck, don't you?",1,8,7
15688,cersei, f,cersei," You're not boring, I'll give you that.",1,8,7
15689,cersei, f,cersei, You might be the most arrogant man I've ever met. I like that.,1,8,13
15690,cersei, f,cersei, But now I want to be alone.,1,8,7
15691,cersei, f,cersei," Our message was well-received, then?",4,8,5
15692,cersei, f,cersei, You're certain about the dragon?,4,8,5
15693,cersei, f,cersei, That must have been glorious.,4,8,5
15694,cersei, f,cersei," When the war is won, the Lion shall rule the land, the Kraken shall rule the sea and our child shall one day rule them all.",4,8,26
15695,cersei, f,cersei," Of course she is. Keep the gates open. If she wants to take the castle, she'll have to murder thousands of innocent people first.",4,8,24
15696,cersei, f,cersei," So much for ""the Breaker of Chains.""",4,8,7
15697,cersei, f,cersei," (to MISSANEDEI) If you have any last words, now is the time.",4,8,12
15698,cersei, f,cersei," My son, this is madness.",9,1,5
15699,cersei, f,cersei,"  Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong.",8,1,8
15700,cersei, f,cersei,"  Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest.",8,1,13
15701,cersei, f,cersei,"  Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt.",8,1,11
15702,cersei, f,cersei,"  You disappoint me, child.",8,1,4
15703,cersei, f,cersei,  That depends.,8,1,2
15704,cersei, f,cersei,  On your brother. And on you.,8,1,6
15705,cersei, f,cersei,  Ser Barristan Selmy.,8,1,3
15706,cersei, f,cersei,"  Rise, Ser Barristan.",8,1,3
15707,cersei, f,cersei,"  Whose death, Ser Barristan? Yours or your King's?",8,1,8
15708,cersei, f,cersei,  The Council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.,8,1,18
15709,cersei, f,cersei,"  Careful, Ser.",8,1,2
15710,cersei, f,cersei,"  Do you have some business for the King and the Council, Sansa?",8,1,12
15711,cersei, f,cersei,  Stop talking. Get back into bed.,10,1,6
15712,cersei, f,cersei," Please, it's nearly healed.",3,1,4
15713,cersei, f,cersei," A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father.",3,1,16
15714,cersei, f,cersei," That's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it.",3,1,52
15715,cersei, f,cersei," Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl.",3,1,77
15716,cersei, f,cersei," No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road.",3,1,17
15717,cersei, f,cersei, How would you handle them?,3,1,5
15718,cersei, f,cersei,  A royal army?,3,1,3
15719,cersei, f,cersei, And if the northerners rebel?,3,1,5
15720,cersei, f,cersei," And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?",3,1,13
15721,cersei, f,cersei,"  But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers.",3,1,12
15722,cersei, f,cersei," The North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies.",3,1,45
15723,cersei, f,cersei,  Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.,3,1,7
15724,cersei, f,cersei, How could you be so stupid?,3,1,6
15725,cersei, f,cersei, He's a child... 10 years old. What were you thinking?,3,1,10
15726,cersei, f,cersei, Nothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.,3,1,7
15727,cersei, f,cersei, What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw...,3,1,15
15728,cersei, f,cersei, And my husband?,3,1,3
15729,cersei, f,cersei, Let me go.,3,1,3
15730,cersei, f,cersei, Let me go.,3,1,3
15731,cersei, f,cersei, And if you find the proof?,3,1,6
15732,cersei, f,cersei, What do you mean?,2,1,4
15733,cersei, f,cersei," It's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain.",2,1,10
15734,cersei, f,cersei, I still can't believe you're going. It's ridiculous even for you.,2,1,11
15735,cersei, f,cersei, The children don't need to hear your filth. Come.,2,1,9
15736,cersei, f,cersei, Please.,2,1,1
15737,cersei, f,cersei," This is your home. I'm your guest. Handsome one, isn't he? I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty. He was a fighter too... Tried to beat the fever that took him. Forgive me. It's the last thing you need to hear right now.",2,1,45
15738,cersei, f,cersei,"  It was years ago. Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care... The boy looked just like him. Such a little thing... A bird without feathers. They came to take his body away and Robert held me. I screamed and I battled, but he held me. That little bundle. They took him away and I never saw him again. Never have visited the crypt, never. I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you.",2,1,95
15739,cersei, f,cersei, Perhaps this time she'll listen.,2,1,5
15740,cersei, f,cersei,  How dare you speak to your King in that manner?,2,1,10
15741,cersei, f,cersei, Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son. That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.,2,1,18
15742,cersei, f,cersei, Joffrey told us what happened. You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.,2,1,20
15743,cersei, f,cersei," She's not. Sansa, come here, darling.",2,1,6
15744,cersei, f,cersei,  She's as wild as that animal of hers. I want her punished.,2,1,12
15745,cersei, f,cersei,  Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life.,2,1,11
15746,cersei, f,cersei,  And what of the direwolf? What of the beast that savaged your son?,2,1,13
15747,cersei, f,cersei, We have another wolf.,2,1,4
15748,cersei, f,cersei,  Where is the beast?,2,1,4
15749,cersei, f,cersei," Ser Ilyn, do me the honor.",2,1,6
15750,cersei, f,cersei, Is this some trick?,2,1,4
15751,cersei, f,cersei," And you never worry about anything. When we were seven, you jumped off the cliffs as Casterly Rock. One hundred foot drop into the water. And you were never afraid.",1,1,30
15752,cersei, f,cersei, What if Jon Arryn told someone?,1,1,6
15753,cersei, f,cersei, My husband.,1,1,2
15754,cersei, f,cersei, You should be the Hand of the king.,1,1,8
15755,cersei, f,cersei," We’ve been riding for a month, my love. Surely the dead can wait.",1,1,13
15756,cersei, f,cersei, Where is our brother? Go find the little beast.,1,1,9
15757,cersei, f,cersei, Yes. Lovely country.,1,1,3
15758,cersei, f,cersei," Hello, little dove. But you are a beauty. How old are you?",1,1,12
15759,cersei, f,cersei, You’re tall. Still growing?,1,1,4
15760,cersei, f,cersei, And have you bled yet?,1,1,5
15761,cersei, f,cersei, And your dress. Did you make it?,1,1,7
15762,cersei, f,cersei, Such talent. You must make something for me.,1,1,8
15763,cersei, f,cersei, I hear we might share a grandchild someday.,1,1,8
15764,cersei, f,cersei, Your daughter will do well in the capital. Such a beauty shouldn’t stay hidden up here forever.,1,1,17
15765,cersei, f,cersei, Stop. STOP.,1,1,2
15766,cersei, f,cersei, He saw us.,1,1,3
15767,cersei, f,cersei, He saw us!,1,1,3
15768,cersei, f,cersei, I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out. You seemed so good together.,5,1,15
15769,cersei, f,cersei," Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces.",5,1,8
15770,cersei, f,cersei, The Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that. They don't have discipline. They don't have armor. They don't have siege weapons.,5,1,21
15771,cersei, f,cersei, Is my father wrong?,5,1,4
15772,cersei, f,cersei, We still outnumber them.,5,1,4
15773,cersei, f,cersei, Five.,5,1,1
15774,cersei, f,cersei, What do you want?,5,1,4
15775,cersei, f,cersei, Our marriage.,5,1,2
15776,cersei, f,cersei, Every day.,5,1,2
15777,cersei, f,cersei," Well, seventeen years is quite a long time.",5,1,8
15778,cersei, f,cersei," Yes, it tis. What was she like?",5,1,7
15779,cersei, f,cersei," At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it.",5,1,85
15780,cersei, f,cersei, What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?,5,1,22
15781,cersei, f,cersei," I felt something for you once, you know?",5,1,8
15782,cersei, f,cersei, It doesn't make me feel anything.,5,1,6
15783,cersei, f,cersei, You're missing your tournament.,4,1,4
15784,cersei, f,cersei, I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us – the ugliness with the wolves. And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme. Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned. How is Sansa?,4,1,41
15785,cersei, f,cersei," The only Stark who does. Favors her mother, not much of the north in her.",4,1,15
15786,cersei, f,cersei,  I might ask the same of you. What is it you hope to accomplish?,4,1,14
15787,cersei, f,cersei," You can't change him. You can't help him. He'll do what he wants, which is all he's ever done. You'll try your best to pick up the pieces.",4,1,28
15788,cersei, f,cersei," You're just a soldier, aren't you? You take your orders and you carry on. I suppose it makes sense. Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow.",4,1,32
15789,cersei, f,cersei, As was I.,4,1,3
15790,cersei, f,cersei, Do you know what your wife has done?,6,1,8
15791,cersei, f,cersei, By what right dare you lay hands on my blood?,6,1,10
15792,cersei, f,cersei, You were the King’s Hand!,6,1,5
15793,cersei, f,cersei, You shall now be held accountable.,6,1,6
15794,cersei, f,cersei, Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime.,6,1,13
15795,cersei, f,cersei, I took you for a king.,6,1,6
15796,cersei, f,cersei, He’s attacked my brother and abducted the other. I should wear the armor and you the gown.,6,1,17
15797,cersei, f,cersei, I shall wear this like a badge of honor.,6,1,9
15798,cersei, f,cersei,  You're in pain.,7,1,3
15799,cersei, f,cersei,  Perhaps it's time to go home.,7,1,6
15800,cersei, f,cersei,"  Do you, Lord Stark? Is that why you called me here, to pose me riddles?",7,1,15
15801,cersei, f,cersei,  Jaime would have killed him.,7,1,5
15802,cersei, f,cersei,  My brother is worth a thousand of your friend.,7,1,9
15803,cersei, f,cersei,  The Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years to keep bloodlines pure.,7,1,13
15804,cersei, f,cersei,  Jaime and I are more than brother and sister.  We shared a womb. We came into this world together. We belong together.,7,1,22
15805,cersei, f,cersei,  Do you love your children?,7,1,5
15806,cersei, f,cersei,  No more than I love mine.,7,1,6
15807,cersei, f,cersei,  Thank the Gods.,7,1,3
15808,cersei, f,cersei,  Hated him? I worshiped him.,7,1,5
15809,cersei, f,cersei,"  And what of my wrath, Lord Stark? You should have taken the realm for yourself.",7,1,15
15810,cersei, f,cersei,"  Oh, but it was.",7,1,4
15811,cersei, f,cersei,"  Robert, my sweet...",7,1,3
15812,cersei, f,cersei,"  May I see that letter, Ser Barristan?",7,1,7
15813,cersei, f,cersei,  We have a new King now.,7,1,6
15814,cersei, f,cersei,"  You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark.",7,1,9
15815,cersei, f,cersei,  You think he stands alone?,7,1,5
15816,cersei, f,cersei, Have been permitted? That’s rather a tortured way of putting it.,8,6,11
15817,cersei, f,cersei, Who permitted them inside the Red Keep?,8,6,7
15818,cersei, f,cersei, The king is aware of their presence?,8,6,7
15819,cersei, f,cersei, His Holiness the High Septon is welcome to see me here in the Red Keep.,8,6,15
15820,cersei, f,cersei," It is a request, Cousin Lancel. You are asking me for something, I’m refusing.",8,6,14
15821,cersei, f,cersei, He promised me I could stay in the Red Keep until my trial.,8,6,13
15822,cersei, f,cersei, Get out.,8,6,2
15823,cersei, f,cersei, I choose violence.,8,6,3
15824,cersei, f,cersei, Please tell His High Holiness he’s always welcome to visit.,8,6,10
15825,cersei, f,cersei, There’s to be a royal announcement?,8,6,6
15826,cersei, f,cersei, Why wasn’t I informed?,8,6,4
15827,cersei, f,cersei, To stand by my son.,8,6,5
15828,cersei, f,cersei, And? Was it just a rumor or something more?,8,6,9
15829,cersei, f,cersei, Confess. Confess.,10,6,2
15830,cersei, f,cersei, Confess.,10,6,1
15831,cersei, f,cersei," Confess. It felt good. Beating me, starving me, frightening me, humiliating me. You didn’t do it because you cared about my atonement. You did it because it felt good. I understand. I do things because they feel good. I drink because it feels good. I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him. I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me. I lie about fucking my brother… because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites. I killed your High Sparrow… and all his little sparrows… all his septons, all his septas, all his filthy soldiers, because it felt good to watch them burn. It felt good to imagine their shock and their pain. No thought has ever given me greater joy. Even confessing feels good under the right circumstances.",10,6,142
15832,cersei, f,cersei, You’ve always been quiet.,10,6,4
15833,cersei, f,cersei, I said my face would be the last thing you saw before you died. Do you remember?,10,6,17
15834,cersei, f,cersei, What? Now? Today? You’re not going to die today. You’re not going to die for quite a while. Ser Gregor.,10,6,20
15835,cersei, f,cersei," This is Ser Gregor Clegane. He’s quiet, too.",10,6,8
15836,cersei, f,cersei, Your gods have forsaken you. This is your god now.,10,6,10
15837,cersei, f,cersei, Shame.,10,6,1
15838,cersei, f,cersei, Shame.,10,6,1
15839,cersei, f,cersei, Shame.,10,6,1
15840,cersei, f,cersei, Show me.,10,6,2
15841,cersei, f,cersei, Show me.,10,6,2
15842,cersei, f,cersei," He should be with his grandfather, his brother, his sister. Burn him and bury his ashes where the sept once stood.",10,6,21
15843,cersei, f,cersei, Varys's little birds?,3,6,3
15844,cersei, f,cersei, The High Sparrow has hundreds of Faith Militant surrounding him. Ser Gregor will can’t face them all. And he won’t have to. He’ll only have to face one.,3,6,28
15845,cersei, f,cersei, Not yet.,3,6,2
15846,cersei, f,cersei," Don’t stop at the city. I want little birds in Dorne, in Highgarden, in the North. If someone is planning on making our losses their gains I want to hear it. If someone is laughing at the queen who walk naked through the streets covered in shit, I want to hear. I want to know who they are. I want to where they are.",3,6,64
15847,cersei, f,cersei, Why are you here?,3,6,4
15848,cersei, f,cersei, Thank you for bringing it up. It’s well past time we addressed the abuses I endured.,3,6,16
15849,cersei, f,cersei," Grand Maester Pycelle, would you sanction that statement?",3,6,8
15850,cersei, f,cersei," What about Myrcella’s death, Uncle? Do you consider the murder of your own blood a troublesome issue?",3,6,17
15851,cersei, f,cersei," And seeing as you cannot make us leave, we best get on with it.",3,6,14
15852,cersei, f,cersei, Get out of my way.,2,6,5
15853,cersei, f,cersei, What are the king’s orders?,2,6,5
15854,cersei, f,cersei, You’re barring me from attending my own daughter’s funeral?,2,6,9
15855,cersei, f,cersei, I would like to speak to my son.,2,6,8
15856,cersei, f,cersei, Did they put her in the red gown or the gold?,2,6,11
15857,cersei, f,cersei, Good. It was always her color.,2,6,6
15858,cersei, f,cersei, I understand. I’m glad to see you.,2,6,7
15859,cersei, f,cersei, It’s all right.,2,6,3
15860,cersei, f,cersei, Always.,2,6,1
15861,cersei, f,cersei, Myrcella…,1,6,1
15862,cersei, f,cersei, Do you remember the first time you saw a dead body?,1,6,11
15863,cersei, f,cersei," All I could think about when she died was what would happen to her now. Every day, every night, what does Mama look like now? Has she started to bloat? Has her skin turned black? Have her lips peeled back from her teeth?",1,6,43
15864,cersei, f,cersei,  I think about locking Myrcella in a crypt.,1,6,8
15865,cersei, f,cersei, I think about her beautiful little face starting to collapse.,1,6,10
15866,cersei, f,cersei, I have to. I have to. It’s not right she has to suffer alone.,1,6,14
15867,cersei, f,cersei," She was good. From her first breath, she was so sweet. I don’t know where she came from. She was nothing like me. No meanness, no jealous, just good.",1,6,29
15868,cersei, f,cersei," I thought if I could make something so good, so pure...maybe I’m not a monster.",1,6,15
15869,cersei, f,cersei," No, I knew this would happen. The witch told me years ago. She promised me three children. She promised me they’d die. “And gold their shrouds.” Everything she said came true. You couldn’t have stopped it. It’s prophecy. It’s fate.",1,6,40
15870,cersei, f,cersei," Of course I do. You told me yourself when Father died. You said we had to stay together. You said people would try to tear us apart, take what’s ours. That was a prophecy, too. I didn’t listen to you, and everything you said came true.",1,6,46
15871,cersei, f,cersei, What are you doing here?,4,6,5
15872,cersei, f,cersei, Leave.,4,6,1
15873,cersei, f,cersei, Is this a Small Council meeting?,4,6,6
15874,cersei, f,cersei," Since I’ve missed the past several Small Coucil meetings, I wanted to speak to you about a few things.",4,6,19
15875,cersei, f,cersei," As have we all, unfortunately.",4,6,5
15876,cersei, f,cersei, Look at me. What did they do to me? To the king’s own mother?,4,6,14
15877,cersei, f,cersei, It’s all right. It's done. It’s in the past. And of course Margaery’s safety is paramount.,4,6,16
15878,cersei, f,cersei," Whether I like her or not is completely unimportant. Margaery is the queen. Queens must command respect. Kings even more so. Not just for their own sake, but for everyone’s. The High Sparrow has no respect for kings or queens. No respect for anything in this world. He has no use for the things of this world. He want to knock them down and replace them with what? With fantasies. With beggars in the street. With nothing.",4,6,77
15879,cersei, f,cersei, You’ve spoken with him?,4,6,4
15880,cersei, f,cersei," It would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly, given his constant prattling about the truth. I am your mother. You can always trust me.",4,6,29
15881,cersei, f,cersei, The Small Council meeting has been postponed on the king’s orders.,4,6,11
15882,cersei, f,cersei, You once spoke of your respect for our father because he understood the necessity of working with one’s rivals.,4,6,19
15883,cersei, f,cersei," The High Sparrow seized power knowing full well we'd bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back. Here we are. Well done to us. Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms rest in his dirty, peasant hands. In a few days, he’ll have a trial for me. But before that, Queen Margaery will make her walk of atonement. Yes, Margaery will repent her sins before the good people of the city.",4,6,71
15884,cersei, f,cersei, I agree.,4,6,2
15885,cersei, f,cersei, You hate these fanatics as much as we do. You hate what they’ve done to your son.  Do you want Lancel back or have you given him up for good?,4,6,30
15886,cersei, f,cersei, Then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed.,4,6,14
15887,cersei, f,cersei, BEtter you’re elsewhere at the head of an army than in the sept dungeons.,6,6,14
15888,cersei, f,cersei," What, then?",6,6,2
15889,cersei, f,cersei, You can’t.,6,6,2
15890,cersei, f,cersei," We should treat them without mercy and we will. But if you kill the High Sparrow, you won’t leave the sept alive. And without you, this is all for nothing. Stand at the head of our army where you belong, where Father wanted you. Show our men where their loyalties belong. Show them what lannisters are, what we do to our enemies. And take that stupid little castle back because it’s ours and because you can.",6,6,76
15891,cersei, f,cersei," It will be a trial by combat. I have the Mountain. They’ve made us both stronger, all of them.",6,6,19
15892,cersei, f,cersei, They have no idea how strong we are. No idea what we’re going to do to them.,6,6,17
15893,cersei, f,cersei, We’ve always been together. We’ll always be together. We’re the only two people in the world.,6,6,16
15894,cersei, f,cersei, I heard you were leaving King’s Landing.,7,6,7
15895,cersei, f,cersei, Your grandson is still a prisoner. You’ll leave him rotting in a cell?,7,6,13
15896,cersei, f,cersei, You’re right. I made a terrible mistake. I carry it with me every single day.,7,6,15
15897,cersei, f,cersei, I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep. And now we must fight them together. We need each other.,7,6,20
15898,cersei, f,cersei, You love your granddaughter. I love my son. It’s the only truth I know. We must defend them.,7,6,18
15899,cersei, f,cersei, Never. I’ll never leave my son.,7,6,6
